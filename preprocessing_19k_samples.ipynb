              " \"Queens Park Rangers manager Harry Redknapp is hoping to bring in some new additions when the January transfer window opens who 'could make the difference' in terms of Barclays Premier League survival. The west London club, promoted back to the top flight after winning the Sky Bet Championship play-off at Wembley, are second from bottom of the table, but only a point behind 17th-placed Crystal Palace. QPR have been linked with a move for former England striker Jermain Defoe, who is with Toronto in the MLS. QPR manager Harry Redknapp has revealed the club are looking to sign one or two players in January. Redknapp believes chairman Tony Fernandes will back him in the transfer market provided the Hoops are not way off the pace in the relegation scrap. 'We are trying, we felt we have to make sure we are still in there,' Redknapp said on talkSPORT. 'If you are cut adrift at Christmas, you don't want to be going and getting yourself into trouble, but if we are still in there with a chance, which I think we will be, then the chairman will go out and let us get one or two players who could make the difference for us. 'We have got one or two targets, and are just waiting to see if we can get them over the line.' QPR, who drew 2-2 at home with champions Manchester City before the international break, host Newcastle on Saturday, with the Magpies now very much on the up having at one time looked set for a survival battle themselves. Jermain Defoe has been consistently linked with a move to QPR where he could reunite with his former boss. Redknapp added 'I look at the table and think there are going to be seven or eight teams involved in that scrap. 'Burnley had a win last week, there is no-one cut adrift yet, it is too early, and if anyone could get back-to-back wins like Newcastle have done, it could all turn quickly. 'We brought a few new players in and it took them time to settle, but they are finding their feet at the club now. 'I think we we have deserved more points with the form we are in, but I would rather play poorly and pick up a few wins.' Redknapp said that Tony Fernandes will let him sign players if QPR are not too far behind in the league.\",\n",

Here\\'s what was said and what was said about it: If you didn\\'t watch live, the Washington Post has the full transcript and video from the press conference. CNN reports Obama \"all but named\" Putin as being behind attempts to influence the election. \"Not much happens in Russia without Vladimir Putin,\" he said, noting he told Putin to \"cut it out\" when they met in person in September. When asked about the slaughter in Aleppo, Obama said \"I always feel responsible\" for incidents around the world,\" according to Haaretz. But ultimately he feels he\\'s \"taken the best course I can\" to end the conflict in Syria and that the \"blood and atrocities\" there are ultimately on Syria and Russia. When a woman in the audience suddenly fainted, Obama stopped the press conference and called for his personal physician to help her out, Us Weekly reports. \"Twitter was full of calls for Obama to sound more of an alarm about his successor, but he chose not to,\" Fusion notes. \"Rather, Obama mostly played nice, saying his meetings with Trump have been \\'cordial.\\'\" NBC News reports Obama sent out a warning to the world regarding cyberattacks against America. \"Our goal continues to be to send a clear message to Russia, and others, to not do this,\" Obama said. \"Because we can do stuff to you.\" Citing a survey that shows 37% of Republican voters approve of Putin, a former KGB head, Obama said, \"Ronald Reagan would roll over in his grave,\" according to Mediaite. Finally, Matt Laslo at the Guardian says Obama blamed the media for Trump\\'s success but \"undermined\" his own cause by doing so. \"Obama, rank and file Democrats, and Republican leaders who actually care about their party’s futures need to reinstate trust in facts and the news organizations that still believe in them.\"',\n",

She says she was attacked by two men after flying to Milan and going to an apartment for a photo shoot. \"I think I lost consciousness,\" she said in a statement to police published in Italian media. \"When I woke up I was wearing a pink bodysuit and the socks I\\'m in now. I realized I was in the [trunk] of a car, with my wrists and ankles tied and my mouth taped.

She says the kidnappers later realized she was the mother of a young child and told her that kidnapping her had been against their organization\\'s rules. Lukasz Pawel Herba, a Polish citizen with British residency, has been arrested, and police say they\\'re seeking at least one more suspect. \"I\\'m incredibly grateful to the Italian and UK authorities for all they have done to secure my safe release,\" Ayling said after returning to the UK over the weekend, per People. \"I am not at liberty to say anything further until I have been debriefed by the UK police.\"',\n",

The Department of Justice filed a brief Thursday supporting Jack Phillips, a Colorado baker who refused to bake a wedding cake for gay couple Charlie Craig and David Mullins in 2012. Phillips, owner of Masterpiece Cakeshop, was found guilty of violating the state\\'s anti-discrimination laws, and the administration\\'s brief urges the Supreme Court to scale back the law so Phillips isn\\'t forced to \"create expression\" that goes against his Christian beliefs, Bloomberg reports. Some 84 House and Senate Republicans have also signed a brief supporting the baker, reports the Hill. \"Forcing Phillips to create expression for and participate in a ceremony that violates his sincerely held religious beliefs invades his First Amendment rights,\" Acting Solicitor General Jeffrey B. Wall wrote in the administration\\'s brief. Louise Melling of the ACLU, which is representing the couple, tells the Washington Post that she\\'s shocked by the filing—even from an administration that has made its \"hostility\" to the gay community obvious. In the case, which could have implications for businesses nationwide, a Colorado court argued that Phillips would not \"convey a message supporting same-sex marriages merely by abiding by the law.\" Lawyers noted that he rejected the couple without asking for details of the proposed cake.',\n",

In the fourth quarter, Minnesota improved its lead on Johnson's 3-yard TD pass to FB Jeff Dugan.  Afterwards, Arizona tried to fight back as Strong Safety Adrian Wilson returned a fumble 99 yards for a touchdown, yet it was followed up by a failed two-point conversion.  Afterwards, QB Matt Leinart completed a 9-yard TD pass to WR Anquan Boldin.  Afterwards, the Vikings wrapped up the game and won.  With the loss, the Cardinals fell to 2-9.\",\n",

But Bartoli today made light of his remarks - inviting Inverdale to ‘come and see me in my ball gown and heels’. Crass remark: John Inverdale has forced the BBC into making an appology after he suggested that Marion Bartoli the women\\'s Wimbledon champion was \\'never going to be a looker\\' Winner: Bartoli was attacked by Trolls on Twitter who criticised her looks and branded her as \\'manly\\' In an interview with journalists from. her own country, Ms Bartoli said she wanted the BBC man to come and see. her at the traditional end-of-Wimbledon ball in London.

I am not blonde, yes. That is a fact. Have I dreamt. about having a model contract? No. I\\'m sorry. But have I dreamed about. winning Wimbledon?

She’s my beautiful daughter.’ He was among friends and family who supported Marion from the players’ box – and she made a beeline for him after claiming her first grand slam title with a 6-1 6-4 victory over German Sabine Lisicki. Twitter users were also highly critical, describing the remark as ‘shameful’ and ‘absolutely disgusting’. One wrote: ‘John Inverdale is never going to be a looker, or a thinker, or as good at anything as Bartoli.’ Another. said: ‘I can’t believe John Inverdale is so unpleasant and sexist about.

Speaking at the start of 5 live\\'s coverage of the men\\'s final between Andy Murray and Novak Djokovic, Inverdale said: ‘Before we start, I probably ought to just briefly return to yesterday and a clumsy phrase that I used about Marion Bartoli which has understandably caused something of a furore. ‘The point I was trying to make, in a rather ham-fisted kind of way, was that in a world where the public perception of tennis players is that they\\'re all 6ft tall Amazonian athletes, Mario - who is the Wimbledon champion - bucks that trend.’ He said she was ‘a fantastic example to all young people that it\\'s attitude and will and determination together, obviously, with talent that, in the end, does get you to the top. ‘So I have apologised to Marion by letter if any offence was caused and I do hope that we can leave the matter there now’. The apology came as Bartoli faced a barrage of abuse from vile online trolls who took to Twitter to criticise her looks, saying that she did not deserve to win as she is too \\'ugly\\'. Another said: \\'For the first time ever a man wins the women\\'s Wimbledon final! Go team men. #balls\\' And she was also told to: \\'get a boob job with the money you won. ugly b****\\'. But the Twitter attacks have prompted an outpouring of criticism online as with Bartoli supporters rushing to her defence. One said: \\'Bartoli as the complete underdog has just won Wimbledon. WHY ARE PEOPLE TALKING ABOUT HER FACE AND BODY!!?!\\' Another added: \\'Sadly being an amazing athlete counts for nothing if you\\'re a woman :(\\' Bartoli. had endured a difficult 2013 before Wimbledon after failing to pass. the third round of any tournament. She had also never won a major tournament before. \\'Honestly I just can\\'t believe it,\\' she said. \\'As a little girl I dreamt about this moment for so long. \\'I. was there in 2007 and I missed out. I know how it feels Sabine, and I\\'m. sure, believe me, you\\'ll be there one more time, I have no doubt about. it. \\'When I started this. campaign on Court 14, I think if you told me I\\'d be here in the final I. wouldn\\'t believe you.

The victims were stripped of their property, meaning there are now many claims from relatives.\\nBut the Jewish claims only account for about 17% of the total. Most relate to Poles who lost property confiscated after the war by the communist regime.\\nThe Polish Union of Property Owners estimates there are about one million claimants and the total value of compensation owing is 95bn zloty.\\nRonald Lauder, President of the World Jewish Congress (WJC), said Poland was \"telling many elderly pre-war landowners, including Holocaust survivors, that they have no foreseeable hope of even a small measure of justice for the assets that were seized from them\".\\nThis criticism led Poland\\'s Foreign Minister, Radoslaw Sikorski, to say that the US had given up its right to represent its citizens in such cases under a compensation agreement from the 1960s. He added that \"a good moment\" for the US to have helped Polish Jews was in 1943-44.\\nThe WJC\\'s Menachem Rosensaft responded by writing an article urging the Jewish community to \"stop injecting tourist and other dollars into the Polish economy\" until Poland enacted a compensation law.\\nThe Polish media quickly labelled this a call for an economic boycott of Poland, which in turn prompted the WJC to announce that Mr Rosensaft was writing in a personal capacity and it did not advocate any such boycott.\\nThe heated exchanges show how sensitive the issue is.\\nMost European countries where this is relevant have already adopted legislation to provide either restitution of property or compensation for confiscations during the Nazi and communist eras.\\nSuccessive Polish governments have pledged to do so as well, but none have been successful. That is partly because of the scale and complexity of the problem here.\\nNot only was Poland home to Europe\\'s largest Jewish community in 1939, but in 1945 the Allies agreed to shift Poland\\'s boundaries westwards. That caused many Germans to lose their homes in Silesia and many Poles to lose theirs in what is now Ukraine, Belarus and Lithuania.\\nThe controversy comes as Jewish culture and history is enjoying a boom among Poles. These days Poles attend Jewish film and cultural festivals, Hebrew classes or sing in Yiddish choirs.\\nPoland also enjoys very good relations with Israel. But the unresolved issue of property restitution is guaranteed to leave a sour taste.',\n",
              " \"By. Leesa Smith. A 'professional mistress' who flaunted her glamorous lifestyle on social media, claiming to have been showered by expensive gifts in her role as a charity worker, has issued a tearful TV apology in China after being arrested in a World Cup betting scandal. Guo Meimei had a huge following on Weibo, China's answer to Facebook, as she posted pictures of expensive cars and from exotic locations, claiming the gifts were given to her as part of her job as a  Red Cross senior manager. Scroll down for video. A remorseful Guo Meimei (pictured) concedes it was her vanity that led her to concoct a story that she was a senior manager in a subsidiary of the Red Cross where she was given outlandish 'gifts' as part of the role. In Guo's tearful apology while bowing in orange prison clothes live on TV, she blamed her illicit behaviour on her huge ego. Guo' s lavish lifestyle was being supported by an illegal gambling operation and also working as a professional mistress for Beijing’s rich and famous. Guo confessed to the gambling-related charges which she had been detained for live on television last month which ended the month-long investigation. However, after she was arrested under the country's strict gambling laws, she was forced to confess she was a £30,000-a-night prostitute who had sex with China's rich elite for money and had no connection with the charity. The Red Cross has since struggled for donations since being dragged into the scandal, prompting her to issue an apology on state television, dressed in an orange prison jumpsuit. 'I like to show off,' she said. 'I have the vain mindset of a little girl.' ‘I would like to tell the Red Cross that I’m sorry. I want to apologise even more to those people who are unable to get help.' 'I like to show off. I have the vain mindset of a little girl,' Guo (pictured left and right) admits. Guo (pictured left with a fan) documented her lavish lifestyle on Weibo where she had almost 1.9 million followers. Partial to public apologies, the 23-year-old confessed to the gambling-related charges last month after being arrested after a month-long investigation by a special cross-provincial police unit, the South China Morning Post reported. Guo admitted to operating an illegal gambling venue in Beijing, as well as having sex with men for money. She also confessed to fabricating that she had a 260 million yuan (HK$327 million) gambling debt in Macau in an attempt to get back into the limelight. At the height of her fame - or infamy - Guo had almost 1.9 million followers on Weibo who seemed gripped by her love of luxury resorts, fast cars, upmarket restaurants and Macau’s casino tables. The cyber fame even led her to shoot a self-funded film of her life story last year which detailed how she went from a troubled childhood in Hunan to study at the Beijing Film Academy before becoming entangled in the Red Cross scandal in 2011. The charity, which unlike its counterparts in other countries is linked with the government, has urged donors on its Weibo page ‘to please forget Guo Meimei’. The skyrocketing cyber fame even led Guo to shoot a self-funded film of her life story last year. Guo wore similar orange prison attire when she apologised to the Red Cross during a TV Interview on Sunday.\",\n",

              " \"Michael I. Sovern is president of Columbia University. By Michael I. Sovern\\n\\n''If you thi nk education is expensive,'' go es an old college fundraising maxim, ''try ignorance.'' The war ning is timely. At a time when Government should be making major new investments incampus research, vital to raising national pr oductivity, the Reagan Administration has embarked on a program of ' 'economies'' that will drastically curtail research efforts in the n ation's universities, turn many of the best from careers in educati on and research, and close the door to first-rate young people who cannot pay today's tuitions.\\n\\nObviously, those assigning us the loser's role in the international technology competition have not intended these consequences. Commenting on the entire Federal budget, David Stockman himself conceded that ''we didn't think it all the way through.''\\n\\nIt is, however, not too late to think it all the way through and reverse the damaging cuts in student aid as well as cuts in the funding of new scientific equipment and in university research budgets - measures that would actually result in ''savings'' of only a fraction of 1 percent of the Federal budget.\\n\\nThe issue is not whether the Federal Government as a whole is spending too much or too little, nor whether the supply-siders, Keynesians or monetarists, have the best of the argument. Whatever the economic faith of our elected officials, increased support for education and research must be given a high priority.\\n\\nThe predominance of American professors among Nobel Prize winners dramatically demonstrates the importance of our campuses in producing men and women who gave this nation the lead it once enjoyed in science and technology. But Nobel Prizes celebrate the accomplishments of yesterday, not tomorrow.\\n\\nToday, at independent universities that trained most of the country's scientists and produced the lion's share of major research advances, world-renowned pioneers are working in physical facilities that are woefully out of date. Although China's scientific development fell far behind us during the Cultural Revolution, a recent group of Chinese visitors were astonished at the antiquated scientific equipment they saw on a tour of a leading Middle Western university.\\n\\nHad they traveled more widely, they would have realized that this was the norm and not the exception. Not only has laboratory equipment been refined at a dizzying pace, but costs have skyrocketed as well. A recent study by the Association of American Universities found that a $750 million investment in scientific equipment and facilities is needed over the next three years simply to sustain current activities at only 15 of the nation's research universities.\\n\\nIt would be hyperbolic to say that we are embarking on our own Cultural Revolution. But one can imagine, without exaggeration, a news story of Jan. 20, 1989, datelined Washington, that reads: ''In her inaugural address, the President called for a multibilliondollar crash program of Federal and private investment in America's university research base. She asserted that radical action is critical to meet the problems posed by the greatest shortage of scientists and scholars in our history. Without it, she said, we have no hope of regaining our position as tenth most productive nation in the world.''\\n\\nSuch a news story would not be farfetched because the per capita gross national product of the United States has slipped to tenth place in the world. Our foreign trade pattern resembles that of an underdeveloped country: We export raw materials in abundance and import more manufactured goods than we sell abroad. All this cannot be isolated from the fact that over the past 15 years, Japan and West Germany have doubled their output of scientists and engineers. Tolerance o f this erosion of our ability to compete in the world runs counter both to the Reagan agenda and to a long and wise tradition. Si nce World War II, the Government has pursued a bipartisan po licy rooted in the recognition that the nation's well-being de pends on a national commitment to the quality of its universities. Federal support produced the rapid growth of graduate schools and t he consequent surge to international pre-eminence of American univ ersity research. The Federal Government has recognized that scientif ic and technological competitions with other nations arewon or lost o n American campuses.\\n\\nMajor research universities cannot but applaud the Reagan Administration's goals of controlling inflation and promoting a sound and stable economy, but these goals are not served by cutbacks in Federal assistance to higher education. When a high-technology company is in danger of losing out to the competition, it invests more in research and development, not less. In the world economy, the United States competes for scientific leadership not only with Japan but with much of Western Europe. If this country is to meet that competition, have a sound economy and bring inflation under control, it must invest more in research and development. Past investment in American universities has been repaid many times over by massive contributions to the national strength. If there is a time to increase that investment, this is it. When Ronald Reagan took office, there was no Federal program to de al with the decaying physical plant of the nation's universities. Th ere was the beginning of a response to the problem of outdated eq uipment, but this was killed by the Office of Management and Bu dget. What all universities had was a respectable program for ma king the most of their ''human capital.'' ''Human capital,'' the ec onomist Eli Ginzberg pointed out, ''defined as the 'skill, de xterity and knowledge' of the population, has become the critical in put that determines the rate of growth of the economy. ...'' This pe rspective underlies the Federal Government's provision since 1965 of nearly $20 billion in loan guarantees and interest subsidies for co llege and university students plus billions more in direct fi nancial aid to students most in need. Session after session of Co ngress concluded that these funds would be a fruitful investment inth is nation's future.\",\n",

As for his interviewing skills, which Oprah described as \"surprising?\" Quips Lowry, \"\\'Boring\\' would be more accurate.\" \"His giggling style might have come across as charming ... in an interview with someone less intimidating,\" writes Chris Rovzar for New York. \"Here it made him seem sycophantic and almost childish.

Could you touch me?\\' I almost turned off the television.\" Ken Tucker at Entertainment Weekly writes that, \"In general, Winfrey was probably as open as she’s ever been with an interviewer, which is to say, not much.\" But despite the softball interview, Tucker believes Morgan has already shown himself to be a more than worthy successor to King. \"Simply by having facts about his subject at hand and speaking coherently, Morgan aced King on his opening night,\" he writes.

              " \"Make sure to consider the bigger picture before making a judgment call. Sometimes it can be easy to mistake an animal that is sick, but receiving veterinary treatment, for a pet that is being abused. For instance, an animal that is very thin may have a medical condition that is being managed, not starving from lack of food. The cat's behavior around his owner can be a good indicator of its feelings towards the owner.  If the cat runs to greet his owner and rubs around his legs purring that is a good sign. If the cat flinches and cowers, it is possible he is being abused. Even this is not conclusive, especially if you witness the cat struggling due to being fed medication or given a bath. To determine if there is a possible explanation for a cat in distress, simply approach the owner and ask gently. Ask him whether the cat is all right, and listen attentively to the answer.  Try to keep your tone conversational. If the owner says the cat is on medical treatment, you can try asking which vet the cat is seeing. If you are not satisfied by the answer, do not confront the owner, but consider putting the problem in the hands of the authorities. Unintentional abuse is just what it sounds like, abuse that occurs due to inadequate care, but is not malevolent. Sadly, even people who consider themselves animal lovers can perpetrate unintentional abuse.  This type of abuse typically involves failing to meet all the animals' basic needs, such as adequate food, clean water, a clean place to rest, and shelter from the elements. Unintentional abuse is common when people hoard more animals than they can care for, or when they neglect their cats by not providing adequate food while they are on holiday. Intentional abuse occurs when the owner knows that the animal is being harmed or injured, but does nothing about it. In the worst case, this can be intentional neglect with cruel intent, intentionally inflicting pain and suffering on the cat. Besides physical injury, intentional abuse includes not taking a sick cat to the vet or not treating a flea infected cat.\",\n",

              " 'Start the breeding process by making sure you can tell the difference between your male and female danios. Male danios are normally skinnier than their female counterparts, and their colours are usually more vibrant. If the females have started to produce roe (eggs), they’ll look chubbier.  Once you’ve sexed your danios, place the males and females into separate tanks to prepare them for breeding. If you’re having a hard time sexing your danios before they’ve been conditioned, you may need to feed them premium live food for a couple of days before you’ll be able to tell them apart. Once you can tell them apart, separate the males from the females. While your male and female danios are in their own tanks, feed them high-quality live food. Live foods for danios include daphnia, bloodworm, and mosquito larvae. You should be able to find live food at most aquarium stores. Continue this process for 1 to 2 weeks before attempting to breed your danios.  If you are unable to obtain live food, you can use frozen food as an alternative.  You should notice the female danios grow rounder as they’re being conditioned! This is a great indication that they’re developing a lot of roe and are ready to breed. After 1 to 2 weeks of conditioning, your adult danios will be ready to breed. In order to be prepared, set up your breeding tank during the first week of conditioning. Your breeding tank can be between 5 and 10 gallons and should contain a filter with an airstone (to help prevent the eggs from being sucked into the filter). If you use tap water for the tank, make sure to add a water dechlorinator to the water. Add a heater to the tank and keep the temperature between 72F and 82F.  Choose between the marble method, the breeder net method, or the spawning mop method for the configuration of your breeding tank. Once you know what configuration method you want to use, you’ll know how much water needs to be put in the tank. Once 1 to 2 weeks have passed, move your danios to the breeding tank you’ve set up. It is best to partner 2 males for every 1 female you move over. Normally danios will breed within 24 hours of being placed in the breeding tank. If they do not, leave them for another 24 hours. If 48 hours pass with no spawning, put your danios back in their separate conditioning tanks for a little longer, and continue to feed them live food. Try breeding the danios again in another week or so.  Spawning simply means the female danios have laid eggs and the male danios have fertilized the eggs. Since you can’t tell if the eggs are fertilized, the best thing to do is watch for eggs at the bottom of the tank. Once you see eggs, you know your danios have spawned and you can move the adults back to their regular tanks. Once you see danio eggs in the breeding tank, remove the adult danios and put them back in their regular tanks. If you used a breeder net, removal will be very easy. If you used the marble or mop methods, you’ll need to use a fish net to capture the danios in order to move them.  Since adult danios will always try to eat the eggs of their young, it is always a good idea to remove the adults from the tank with the eggs. The baby danios aren’t really safe from the adults until they’re all about the same size. Once your baby danios have reached adult size, you can put the “sons” with the “fathers” and the “daughters” with the “mothers”. Although, for genetic purposes, you may want to keep track of the different generations if you are planning to breed them again.',\n",

But they are hard-core hackers who claim to have gained access to the world\\'s most sensitive sites, including the Pentagon. The leader of these Chinese hackers says there \"is always a weakness\" on networks that allows cyber break-ins. In fact, they say they are sometimes paid secretly by the Chinese government -- a claim the Beijing government denies. \"No Web site is one hundred percent safe. There are Web sites with high-level security, but there is always a weakness,\" says Xiao Chen, the leader of this group. \"Xiao Chen\" is his online name. Along with his two colleagues, he does not want to reveal his true identity. The three belong to what some Western experts say is a civilian cyber militia in China, launching attacks on government and private Web sites around the world.  Watch hackers\\' clandestine Chinese operation ». If there is a profile of a cyber hacker, these three are straight from central casting -- young and thin, with skin pale from spending too many long nights in front of a computer. One hacker says he is a former computer operator in the People\\'s Liberation Army; another is a marketing graduate; and Xiao Chen says he is a self-taught programmer. \"First, you must know about the Web site you want to attack. You must know what program it is written with,\" says Xiao Chen. \"There is a saying, \\'Know about both yourself and the enemy, and you will be invincible.\\'\" CNN decided to withhold the address of these hackers\\' Web site, but Xiao Chen says it has been operating for more than three years, with 10,000 registered users. The site offers tools, articles, news and flash tutorials about hacking. Private computer experts in the United States from iDefense Security Intelligence, which provides cybersecurity advice to governments and Fortune 500 companies, say the group\\'s site \"appears to be an important site in the broader Chinese hacking community.\" Arranging a meeting with the hackers took weeks of on-again, off-again e-mail exchanges. When they finally agreed, CNN was told to meet them on the island of Zhoushan, just south of Shanghai and a major port for China\\'s navy. The apartment has cement floors and almost no furniture. What they do have are three of the latest computers. They are cautious when it comes to naming the Web sites they have hacked. On camera, Xiao Chen denies knowing anyone who has targetted U.S. government Web sites. But off-camera, in conversations over three days, he claims two of his colleagues -- not the ones with him in the room -- hacked into the Pentagon and downloaded information, although he wouldn\\'t specify what was gleaned. CNN has no way to confirm if his claim is true. \"They would not publicize this,\" he says of someone who hacks the U.S. Defense Department. \"It is very sensitive.\" This week, the Pentagon said computer networks in the United States, Germany, Britain and France were hit last year by what they call \"multiple intrusions,\" many of them originating from China.

Watch Pentagon bans Google from bases ». \"We are here today because we must do more,\" said Robert Jamison, a top official in the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. \"Defending the federal system in its current configuration is a significant challenge.\" U.S. officials have been cautious not to directly accuse the Chinese military or its government of hacking into its network. But David Sedney, the deputy assistant secretary of defense for East Asia, says, \"The way these intrusions are conducted are certainly consistent with what you would need if you were going to actually carry out cyber warfare.\" Beijing hit back at that, denying such an allegation and calling on the United States to provide proof. \"If they have any evidence, I hope they would provide it. Then, we can cooperate on this issue,\" Qin Gang, a spokesman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry, said during a regular press briefing this week. But again off-camera, Xiao Chen says after the alleged Pentagon attack, his colleagues were paid by the Chinese government. CNN has no way to independently confirm if that is true. His allegations brought strenuous denials from Beijing. \"I am telling you honestly, the Chinese government does not do such a thing,\" Qin said. But if Xiao Chen is telling the truth, it appears his colleagues launched a freelance attack -- not initiated by Beijing, but paid for after the fact. \"These hacker groups in my opinion are not agents of the Chinese state,\" says James Mulvenon from the Center for Intelligence Research and Analysis, which works with the U.S. intelligence community. \"They are sort of useful idiots for the Beijing regime.\" He adds, \"These young hackers are tolerated by the regime provided that they do not conduct attacks inside of China.\" One of the biggest problems experts say is trying to prove where a cyber attack originates from, and that they say allows hackers like Xiao Chen to operate in a virtual world of deniability. And across China, there could be thousands just like him, all trying to prove themselves against some of the most secure Web sites in the world. E-mail to a friend.',\n",

The New York family of a newlywed bride killed in India last month are calling for local authorities there to investigate her suicide death, which they are calling 'mysterious'. Bhoomika Kochhar, 25, from Long Island, was found hanging in the bathroom of her home on June 15 while living in Nepal with her husband and his family. Her family have accused her husband of driving her to suicide and claims he treated her like a slave, abused her and demanded a dowry. The pretty 25-year-old told her family she wanted to divorce her husband just two years after they had what was called 'the most extravagant wedding in Nepal'. Their nuptials took place over three-days and was attended by more than 1,000 people at. the Hyatt Regency in Nepal. Suicide: Bhoomika Kochhar, 25, from Long Island, was found hanging in the bathroom of her home on June 15 while living in Nepal with her husband and his family. Support: Rep Steve Israel says he is pressuring the Nepal government and will not be satisfied until a full investigation into her death is completed. Distraught: The Kochhar family are calling for a full investigation into their daughter's 'mysterious' death as they believe her husband drove her to suicide. Chefs came from Thailand, Macau, Japan, Dubai and India and her makeup was done by Bollywood artists. Bhoomika’s sister, Priyanka Kochhar Puri, told the\\xa0New York Daily News: 'Since her death, we have learned that. she was regularly and persistently yelled at, locked in rooms, denied. food, ridiculed and demeaned, restricted in her movements outside the. home, and subject to all manner of petty and mean spirited discipline. 'Meanwhile, the Jatia family rigorously. observed another custom - they made regular and persistent dowry demands,. including requests and demands for cash, jewelry, and lavish gifts.' The family contacted Rep Steve Israel, who says he is pressuring the Nepal government and will not be satisfied until a full investigation into her death is completed. He has even threatened to withhold $27 million in aid to Nepal until he’s satisfied a proper probe has taken place. Father Chander Kochhar said: 'So far, we have lost our daughter and nothing has happened.' Nuptials: The couple had what was called 'the most extravagant wedding in Nepal' - a three-day ceremony attended by more than 1,000 people at the Hyatt Regency in Nepal. Publicity: Nepali magazine Wedding Bells did a spread on the couple's wedding two years ago. Hanged: Bhoomika was born in India and gained U.S. citizenship as a child. She is a Boston University graduate. They said there are a number of suspicious circumstances surrounding the death of Bhoomika, who gained U.S. citizenship as a child and graduated from Boston University. When she died, her husband Akaash Jatia took her body to a local hospital but gave false names for both of them. He then went to another hospital which is controlled by his father, the Kochars told the Daily News. The Kathmandu Post reported that Nepali police doubted Bhoomika could have hanged herself in the bathroom, because the ceiling was too low. 'Even if she hanged herself by the window pane, her feet would have touched the ground,' an unnamed official told the paper. Nepali magazine Wedding Bells describes Jatia’s father, Anil, as an executive at Jagdamba Group, a prominent conglomerate in Nepal. The family have refused to comment on Bhoomika's death. .\",\n",

              " '(CNN)  -- Dr. George Tiller knew that violence could come at any moment. For a reminder, he needed to think only of the old gunshot wounds in his arms from 1993 or the bombing of his clinic years earlier. Dr. George Tiller was one of the few U.S. physicians who performed late-term abortions. Still, Tiller, who was fatally shot at his Kansas church Sunday, continued to provide the late-term abortions that often brought protesters to his Women\\'s Health Care Services clinic in Wichita. Tiller, one of the few physicians who was still offering such abortions in the United States, \"made an effort to live his life as normally as possible, knowing he could be a target at any time,\" said Peter Brownlie, president of the regional Planned Parenthood office in Kansas City, Missouri. Normal came with an asterisk. The 67-year-old had armed security at his clinic and a \"pretty rigorous\" security procedure at home, Brownlie said. Scott Roeder from the Kansas City, Kansas, area is being held without bail in the shooting, according to the sheriff\\'s office Web site. A motive wasn\\'t immediately known. But if someone targeted Tiller for his work, it wouldn\\'t be the first time. \"What a gentle soul,\" said Suzanne Poppema, chairwoman of the board for the Physicians for Reproductive Choice and Health, national network of abortion-rights physicians who are committed to providing the best possible care for patients. Tiller also served on the board for the group.\"He was a rational intelligent human being.\" Poppema called his death\"the ultimate backwardness.\" She said the threat of attack was often a concern for Tiller and is a worry for many doctors and medical students who choose to perform abortions. \"It wears on your psychology, because you always have to be looking over your shoulder, thinking, \\'Is today OK or not OK?\\' \" Poppema said. \"Because you are doing work that is medically correct and yet having to operate as if you live in a war zone.\" Poppema said the attacks, even after Tiller was shot through both arms in 1993, didn\\'t deter him from practicing. An ardent foe of abortion, Shelley Shannon, was convicted of attempted murder and is serving a 20-year sentence in federal prison for the shooting.  See all abortion-related attacks since 1993 ». Tiller\\'s clinic was damaged by a bombing in the mid-1980s, and it has been picketed for years, with some activists distributing leaflets around his neighborhood, Brownlie said.  Watch background on George Tiller ». \"He endured that kind of stuff on a very frequent basis,\" Brownlie said. \"As recently as early this month, the clinic sustained serious vandalism that put them out of commission for a week or so.\" Tiller, a former Navy flight surgeon, took over his father\\'s Wichita medical practice where abortions were performed during a time when the procedure was illegal. Tiller\\'s practices had an effect on proposed abortion legislation. This year, before she was sworn in as U.S. secretary of health and human services, Kansas Gov. Kathleen Sebelius vetoed a bill that would have required doctors to give more details when justifying late-term abortions to the state health department, the Wichita Eagle reported. Tiller also made a mark on Sebelius\\' confirmation process for the health and human services post. Sebelius came under fire in part because Tiller and his staff attended a 2007 reception that Sebelius held at the governor\\'s mansion and because she originally failed to account for donations she received from him. Tiller, a University of Kansas medical school graduate, had been practicing medicine for about 40 years, starting as an intern at a U.S. naval hospital and later becoming a Navy flight surgeon in California, according to his clinic\\'s Web site. He started providing abortion services in 1973 and became the clinic\\'s director two years later, according to the Web site. The clinic also provided grief counseling and funerals. His patients were \"almost always in circumstances where something had gone horribly wrong with a pregnancy\" and where a woman\\'s health would be endangered if the pregnancy continued, Brownlie said. His willingness to perform late-term abortions as more and more doctors abandoned them made Tiller a lightning rod for anti-abortion rights activists and legislators. Kansas law generally allows abortions even into the third trimester so long as the physician determines that the fetus isn\\'t viable. A doctor who makes such a determination after 21 weeks gestation must report the reasons why the determination was made. \"Third-trimester abortion is simply a part of abortion,\" Tiller told Wichita TV station KAKE in 1999. \"We have constructed our clinic and our philosophy along the lines that until you have natural survivalhood [of the fetus], the woman is the patient, not the fetus. \"When does natural survivalhood come on? ... Sometime after the end of the second trimester.\"  Watch panel discuss implications of his slaying ». But even if a fetus is determined to be viable after 21 weeks, Kansas law still permits a doctor to perform an abortion if that physician and another determine that the procedure is necessary to preserve the life of the woman. Tiller was the only Kansas doctor still performing late-term abortions in Kansas, the Wichita Eagle reported. His Web site said his clinic had \"more experience in late abortion services over 24 weeks than anyone else currently practicing in the Western Hemisphere, Europe and Australia.\" He faced repeated legal challenges. In March, he was acquitted on 19 misdemeanor counts relating to how he obtained second opinions for late-term abortions, according to the Wichita newspaper. In 2008, an inquiry initiated by abortion opponents who petitioned state authorities to convene a grand jury ended without charges. Tiller is survived by a wife, four children and 10 grandchildren. In a statement issued Sunday through Tiller\\'s lawyers, his family said their loss \"is also a loss for the City of Wichita and women across America.\" \"George dedicated his life to providing women with high-quality health care despite frequent threats and violence. We ask that he be remembered as a good husband, father and grandfather and a dedicated servant on behalf of the rights of women everywhere.\" CNN\\'s Matt Smith and Josh Levs contributed to this report.',\n",

Andrew Mitchell launched an astonishing attack on the Metropolitan Police over the Plebgate affair last night – after a 12-month inquiry concluded there was insufficient evidence that a Number 10 police officer had lied. The former Tory chief whip named PC Toby Rowland – with whom he clashed in Downing Street – branding him a serial liar and demanding that he repeat his claims that he used the word ‘plebs’ on oath. Mr Mitchell flatly denies claims by the officer that he used the word after he was stopped cycling through the street’s gates last September. Andrew Mitchell (pictured with his wife Dr Sharon Bennett) has said he ntends to bring PC Rowland to 'justice' and re-instate his reputation. His denunciation came as prosecutors yesterday decided a single officer should face trial following a mammoth police investigation, which involved taking more than 1,100 statements. PC Keith Wallis, 53, was charged with misconduct in a public office over allegations he falsely claimed he witnessed the row. Five officers from the Met’s Diplomatic Protection Group, including Wallis, will now face gross misconduct hearings for discreditable conduct, meaning they could lose their jobs. Three others will face less serious disciplinary proceedings. related]. But, crucially, the Crown Prosecution Service said there was insufficient evidence to show that PC Rowland, 43, lied about what had happened. Nor is he facing a misconduct inquiry. Mr Mitchell claimed the police had failed to even interview PC Rowland as a suspect about what happened. And he accused Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe of prematurely clearing his officers of wrongdoing. Mr Mitchell said: ‘PC Toby Rowland, who was responsible for writing those toxic phrases into his notebook, was not telling the truth. 'I will seek to say this on oath in a court of law and it is our intention to ensure that PC Toby Rowland has similarly to swear his account. ‘I understand that PC Toby Rowland has not been arrested or even interviewed under criminal caution during the police inquiry.’ The former Tory chief whip named PC Toby Rowland - with whom he clashed in Downing Street - branding him a serial liar and demanding that he repeat his claims that he used the word 'plebs' on oath. In a statement, PC Rowland said last night: ‘I stand by my account of events in Downing Street on 19th September 2012. 'This has now been thoroughly investigated and the CPS has confirmed there is insufficient evidence to take any criminal proceedings against me. ‘In addition, neither am I subject to any disciplinary proceedings. 'I confirm that I am prepared to give evidence under oath if required.’ Mr Mitchell is suing The Sun newspaper, which printed the original report, for libel and said he believed the paper would have to call PC Rowland to corroborate the paper’s account, forcing him to give evidence on oath. Scotland Yard said PC Rowland was interviewed under ‘police misconduct regulations’ – not under police caution. But it added his statement could have been used against him had he been charged with criminal or internal disciplinary offences. The announcement by new Director of Public Prosecutions Alison Saunders fell far short of the result that Mr Mitchell had sought if he is to resume his cabinet career. She said: ‘We have considered all of the evidence in this case, including previously unseen, unedited CCTV footage from Downing Street, not referred to by the media. 'Taking it all into account, including the accounts of the officer at the gate of Downing Street and that of Andrew Mitchell MP before, during and after the incident, we have found that there is insufficient evidence to show that the officer at the gate lied in his account. ‘The CPS has also found that there is insufficient evidence to show that Mr Mitchell was the victim of a conspiracy of misinformation.’ Her lawyers also found that a jury would be likely to decide that the leaking of an email in the affair was in the public interest, a finding that could undermine Mr Mitchell’s attempt to sue the Sun. Sir Bernard said: ‘This investigation has been a ruthless search for the truth as at the heart of this are extremely damaging allegations that officers have lied and falsified statements against a Cabinet Minister.’ A Channel 4 documentary into the Plebgate affair has been called into question by the new head of the Crown Prosecution Service. Last December’s programme – hailed by Andrew Mitchell and his supporters – appeared to cast doubt on the officers’ account of what happened. It revealed CCTV footage which showed there was not a large group of tourists outside the main gate of Downing Street at the time of the altercation as had originally been claimed. Mr Mitchell at the gate where he clashed with the officer. He flatly denies claims that he used the word after he was stopped cycling through the street's gates last September. But Director of Public Prosecutions Alison Saunders, who succeeded Keir Starmer QC earlier this month, said the programme ‘showed edited footage that was less than clear in a number of regards’. She said in her 1,800-word statement on Plebgate: ‘Much of the press reporting to date has assumed that the CCTV recordings show that the gate officer lied about the words used during the incident. ‘The CCTV footage that has been aired publicly was edited and did not show the full picture. ‘We have been supplied with previously unseen and unedited footage of the incident from five different cameras. The CCTV footage does not determine the issue completely as it could be consistent with either the accounts of the officer on the gate or Mr Mitchell. ‘It is clear from the footage that there was sufficient time for the words to have been said either as described by the gate officer or as described by Mr Mitchell, and this has been confirmed by an expert.’ A Channel 4 spokesman defended its journalism on Plebgate. He said: ‘The CCTV footage was obtained by Andrew Mitchell from Downing Street and provided to Dispatches and Channel\\xa0 4 News. The footage as broadcast for the first time on 18th December 2012 was not edited by the production team to change or alter the sequence of events. ‘Furthermore the three camera angles that we were provided with were image-matched frame by frame to confirm their veracity. We stand fully behind this investigation.’ At his televised press conference yesterday, Mr Mitchell made clear his appreciation of the Channel 4 documentary, and selected Michael Crick, Channel 4 News’s political correspondent – with whom he enjoys a strong professional relationship – to ask him the first question from the floor.

              " \"Midfielder Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain loves playing in such an attacking Arsenal team - but accepts they will always have to work at keeping it tight at the back. Arsenal recovered from going behind in the north London derby to a breakaway Tottenham goal for Nacer Chadli as Oxlade-Chamberlain's close-range strike secured a 1-1 draw. Arsene Wenger's side, however, had enjoyed plenty of possession and should have been ahead before a lapse in concentration from defensive midfielder Matheiu Flamini allowed Christian Eriksen to snatch the ball and set-up a swift counter. Arsenal's Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain slots home the equaliser against local rivals Tottenham on Saturday. Oxlade-Chamberlain accepts it is a part of Arsenal's game which can hurt them, but is worth it for what the Gunners offer going forwards. 'That is the risk you take when you play the way we play football,' said England international Oxlade-Chamberlain. 'We try to take control of games, we like to set the tempo, We send a lot of bodies forward in a positive and attacking fashion and you do leave yourself at times a little bit vulnerable to the counter-attack. Oxlade-Chamberlain celebrates netting against Tottenham Hotspur in the north London derby at the Emirates. Arsene Wenger's side salvaged a point thanks to Oxlade-Chamberlain's first Gunners goal since February. 'It is just important that when we do, we have got people in the team that are willing to take the responsibility of holding back and being there to stop counter-attacks. 'But, yeah, I do love playing in this team and the style of play that we do, as I think all the players could say. 'We do, though, need to obviously be careful and make sure we are defending at the same time as when we are attacking. 'It is something we have always worked on because it is an area I am sure teams look at to try and break us down, so we have got to be ready for that.' Oxlade-Chamberlain handles the ball last season at Chelsea, which resulted in Kieran Gibbs being sent off. Despite attempts to reason with referee Andre Mariner after Kieran Gibbs was sent-off at Chelsea last season. Arsenal head to leaders Chelsea next weekend, where they were thumped 6-0 last season, in what was Wenger's 1,000th match in charge. Oxlade-Chamberlain, though, insisted that result would not make Arsenal any less cavalier. 'We do understand what happened there last season. Maybe we have got a point to prove there, we know this year we have got to step up in the big games and get some results in them,' he said. 'We are really looking forward to that game and we definitely give Chelsea the respect they deserve, but, at the same time, I have belief in my team-mates and we do in ourselves to be able to go to a place like Chelsea and set the tempo and hopefully take control of the game. 'There will be times in the game I am sure when they have a spell, because they are a top team. 'They are going to have their time, we are going to have ours, we just have to make sure that when we do have our chances we make them count.' Aaron Ramsey of Arsenal holds his leg as he lies on the pitch after picking up an injury against Tottenham. Arsenal were left counting the cost of injuries against Spurs, with captain Mikel Arteta and Aaron Ramsey limping off in the first half, before Jack Wilshere, who suffered a twisted ankle, was replaced for the final 30 minutes. Wenger was at a loss to explain why soft tissue injuries continue to dog his squad. 'I don't know if we really have to look at it because there is no logic there,' said the Arsenal manager. 'It is two players who were not involved in the (cup) game in the week. We had quite a light week for them and we have to analyse what happened to them. I don't understand.'

              " 'Two men remanded in custody, one kept for questioning and one freed after Madrid court is told of plan for larger-scale attacks \\n  \\n The terror cell that brought carnage to north-eastern Spain, killing 15 people and injuring more than 130, was planning attacks on a much larger scale, including the bombing of Barcelona’s Sagrada Família church, a suspect has told a court. \\n  \\n Mohamed Houli Chemlal made the admission after being brought before a judge in Madrid, Spanish media reported, quoting court officials. \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n Houli, 21, confirmed what police said they had concluded last week: that the group had been planning large-scale bomb attacks before an explosion ripped through a house in Alcanar where a number of them had been staying, killing two of the plotters. \\n  \\n One of the proposed targets was the Sagrada Família, the half-finished church designed by the Catalan architect Antoni Gaudí that is one of Barcelona’s best loved buildings. \\n  \\n Houli arrived at the audiencia nacional in hospital-issue pyjamas, his right arm bandaged and his face bearing some of the injuries he is said to have sustained in the explosion last week. \\n  \\n He was the first of four suspects to be questioned by Judge Fernando Andreu. \\n  \\n A Spanish national from Melilla, one of the country’s north African enclaves, Houli was arrested in hospital after police realised that the house in Alcanar, in southern Catalonia, had been turned into a bomb factory. \\n  \\n The other three men who appeared in court were arrested in Ripoll, 145 miles north of Alcanar. They were Mohammed Aallaa, 27, whose blue Audi car was driven by five members of the group into a number of pedestrians in Cambrils, a coastal town south of Barcelona; Sahal el Karib, a Moroccan-born businessman in his 30s; and Driss Oukabir, 27, whose brother Moussa, 17, was one of five men shot dead after the Cambrils attack. \\n  \\n Last week Driss Oukabir told police that his brother had stolen his documents to hire vans used in the attacks. However, according to reports of his court appearance on Tuesday, he admitted to the judge that he had hired the vans but claimed he had believed they were needed for a house move. \\n  \\n All four suspects were represented by court-appointed lawyers. The judge later remanded Oukabir and Houli in custody charged with membership of a terrorist organisation and murder, ordered that Karib be held for a further 72 hours pending further questioning, and freed Aallaa. \\n  \\n As the hearing progressed, police were attempting to reconstruct the final 96 hours in the life of the member of the cell who killed 13 people and injured more than 130 others when he drove a hired Fiat van along the crowded Las Ramblas last Thursday. \\n  \\n CCTV images show Younes Abouyaaqoub clambering out of the white van after it crashed into a newspaper kiosk and walking slowly away through La Boqueria, the famous covered food market beside Las Ramblas. \\n  \\n He is now known to have escaped from the city in a car that he took from a vineyard worker, Pau Peréz. Abouyaaqoub approached Peréz in the Universitaria district in the north of the city, killed him by stabbing him in the chest, bundled his body into the back of the Ford Focus car and drove away. \\n  \\n Nothing more was seen of Abouyaaqoub until he was cornered on a road in the Subirats district, 30 miles west of Barcelona, on Monday afternoon. When police approached him he is said to have shouted “God is great” in Arabic and opened his shirt to show what appeared to be a suicide vest. \\n  \\n The officers immediately shot and killed him. He was the sixth member of the cell to be shot dead. \\n  \\n Police kept their distance and used a robot to examine the device Abouyaaqoub was wearing. Like the devices worn by the five men who were shot dead in Cambrils early on Friday, it was fake. \\n  \\n Abouyaaqoub appeared not to have washed between Thursday and Monday. Police believe he walked to Subirats by night and hid by day. He was carrying a knife wrapped in plastic when he died, but had no bag, no phone and no money. He had changed his clothes, however: police do not know where he did this. \\n  \\n In Morocco, a 34-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of being connected to the cell. He is understood to be a cousin of the Oukabir brothers, and previously lived in Ripoll. \\n  \\n Court officials told Spanish media that Houli also confirmed investigators’ suspicions that the cell had been radicalised and was organised by Abdelbaki Es Satty, an imam in Ripoll. \\n  \\n Es Satty, who was in his 40s, was one of two people who died in the bomb factory explosion in which Houli was injured. Houli told the court that Es Satty had intended to mount a suicide bomb attack. \\n  \\n A number of relatives of the dead terrorists have told how Es Satty attempted, without success, to make them become religiously more conservative. “He wanted to give me some talk and one day he started telling me that listening to music was bad,” one relative told El País newspaper. “I told him not to brainwash me. He never spoke to me again.” \\n  \\n In Ripoll, friends of Abouyaaqoub recalled him as a “calm, rather quiet, somewhat shy” young man, who had been a good student and who had studied, almost effortlessly, for a degree in electromechanics. He was said to have had two passions: cars and football. \\n  \\n Meanwhile, the French interior minister has confirmed reports that the Audi used by the terrorists in the attack in Cambrils had been caught on camera speeding in Paris. \\n  \\n Gérard Collomb said of the terrorists that “this group came to Paris but it was a quick arrival and departure”. \\n  \\n French media reported that the car went through the Paris region about a week before last week’s attacks and that it had also been spotted in the Essonne region south of the capital. ||||| Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The four suspects were transferred to a Madrid jail on Monday night \\n  \\n The cell behind the Barcelona van attack had planned to use explosives against monuments including the city\\'s famous Sagrada Familia church, a suspect has told a Madrid court. \\n  \\n Mohamed Houli Chemlal is one of four surviving suspects who gave evidence. \\n  \\n He and Driss Oukabir have both been charged with membership of a terrorist organisation and murder. \\n  \\n Salah al-Karib has been detained pending further investigations, while Mohammed Aallaa was released on bail. \\n  \\n According to Houli Chemlal, the group\\'s plans - which he had known of \"for at least two months - were scaled back when a house packed with bomb-making equipment blew up the day before. \\n  \\n He was injured in the accidental blast that reduced the house to rubble in the town of Alcanar. \\n  \\n The Alcanar explosion came the day before Thursday\\'s Barcelona attack in which a van was driven at speed down the main Las Ramblas boulevard, killing 13 and injuring more than 100. \\n  \\n Judicial sources quoted Houli Chemlal as telling the court a much bigger series of attacks had been planned. \\n  \\n Assailants killed a total of 15 people in the van attack, the stabbing of a driver whose car was commandeered shortly afterwards, and a car attack in the resort of Cambrils hours later. \\n  \\n Eight members of the cell are dead - two were killed in the Alcanar explosion, and six were later shot by police, including five after the Cambrils attack. \\n  \\n Image copyright EPA Image caption The four suspects in court were (L-R) Mohammed Aallaa, Mohamed Houli Chemlal, Sahal al-Karib and Driss Oukabir \\n  \\n The last suspect to be killed was Moroccan-born Younes Abouyaaqoub, 22, believed to be the driver of the Las Ramblas van. \\n  \\n Wearing a fake explosives belt and armed with knives, he was shot dead by police in a vineyard west of Barcelona on Monday. \\n  \\n The surviving suspects were moved, under high security, from Barcelona to Madrid for Tuesday\\'s hearing. \\n  \\n The court session, a preliminary hearing to gather evidence for a future trial, took place behind closed doors. \\n  \\n Houli Chemlal was the first to testify, wearing hospital pyjamas.

              " \"Education Secretary Nicky Morgan has set out plans or schools to 'actively promote' fundamental British values, in the wake of concern some schools were being taken over by extremists. Nicky Morgan’s drive to promote British values in schools undermines Christian teaching and is potentially dangerous, divisive and undemocratic, the Church of England has warned. The Education Secretary was accused of adopting a ‘narrow’ set of values following the Trojan Horse scandal, ignoring Christian concepts such as ‘loving one’s neighbour’. The Church, which is responsible for teaching about one million English children, fears Mrs Morgan’s definition of Britishness could be used too narrowly to test whether individuals are ‘safe’ and ‘loyal’ citizens. It also criticised the use of Ofsted inspectors to ‘police’ the teaching of equality and diversity. The comments come in response to rules, drawn up by former education secretary Michael Gove, intended to prevent Muslim extremism in schools, following claims of a plot to take over governing bodies in Birmingham. Schools must ‘actively promote’ British values such as democracy, tolerance, mutual respect, individual liberty and the rule of law. But complaints have been made that, in efforts to prevent religious extremism, the rules are having ‘disturbing consequences’ for moderate faith schools. It emerged last month that a small Christian primary school in Reading was warned it could face closure for failing to invite imams and other religious leaders to take assemblies. Trinity Christian School was told by Ofsted it was not adequately ensuring the ‘spiritual, moral, social and cultural development’ of pupils. Its governors claim the school’s aims are being undermined and that it will be prevented in future from ‘teaching in accordance with our Christian foundation’. The Church has accused Mrs Morgan of giving herself and her successors ‘very wide powers’ and ‘closing down’ public debate. In what is likely to be seen as a reference to developments such as new gay marriage laws, it said rapid changes in society had been ‘unsettling’ for many. The Church’s chief education officer, the Rev Nigel Genders, warned against ‘rejecting all forms of religion from our schools’. The Church of England warns that government ministers should not decide what is included in British values, but should reflect the views and teachings of religious figures like the Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby. He said, in an online essay this week, Church schools had never ‘been about indoctrination or recruitment’ but that extremism thrived if religion was ‘banished to dark corners’. ‘We wholeheartedly support the idea of schools being required to promote the values of tolerance and respect for those coming at things from a different perspective,’ Mr Genders wrote. ‘However, “British values” cannot be allowed to become a test … of whether somebody in a community is “safe” or “loyal”.’ He said changes in ‘equality and diversity’ in recent years remain ‘in many ways unresolved’ and some groups had found them ‘unsettling’. Mr Genders added that policing the changes with ‘an ever increasing inspection regime’ would not increase public confidence in them. In the Church’s response to the rules, it said the Coalition’s definition of British values was too narrow, ignoring Christian themes. ‘We are concerned that British values should emanate from a broad public conversation and not from the Secretary of State,’ the document warned. ‘By assuming the power to decide what reasonable or unreasonable behaviour is … [Mrs Morgan] would be taking very wide powers for herself and her successors and closing down the broader public debate.’ It described the ‘British values test’ as a ‘negative and divisive’ way define national identity.\",\n",

Mourinho has assembled the Chelsea side we are enjoying this season and right now they are playing as well — and as attractively — as any team in Europe. The manager was invited to praise Costa and Oscar afterwards but he quite rightly pointed to the fact that every player in the side deserved praise. He mentioned John Terry, Filipe Luis and Branislav Ivanovic in response but he could just have easily pointed to the commanding midfield display of Cesc Fabregas and Nemanja Matic. The finishing of Oscar and Costa was nevertheless superb. The opening Chelsea goal, scored after just 49 seconds, might have owed much to Gylfi Sigurdsson’s wayward pass — one seemingly intended for Ashley Williams but one that was diverted into the path of Oscar when it struck Tom Carroll — but it remained a marvellous strike. There was the briefest glimpse of a riposte when Sigurdsson sent a shot crashing against the angle of post and crossbar in the second minute but after that Swansea pretty much folded. When Fabregas, so composed and confident alongside the marvellous Matic, executed a delightful one-two with Willian before feeding the ball into Costa, goal number two arrived in the 20th minute. Costa, much like Oscar, produced a fierce, low finish Lukasz Fabianski was powerless to stop. Chelsea were so in control, with Willian seeing one shot bounce off a post and another rebound off the crossbar. But when Federico Fernandez contrived in the 34th minute to knock a back-pass into the path of Costa, the Spaniard extended Chelsea’s lead with another deadly strike. Garry Monk shouts instructions to his players during their capitulation against Chelsea. Man of the match Oscar's heat map from the Premier League clash on Saturday afternoon. Swansea's Nelson Oliveira dribbles with the ball while being closed down by Chelsea midfielder Nemanja Matic. Swansea captain Williams confronts Costa after an off the ball clash in the second half. For Monk it was clearly proving very painful, Swansea’s manager watching in despair as another goal arrived within two minutes. This time Willian sparked the move with a burst from midfield and a delightful pass out to Costa on the right flank, with Costa then delivering to the ball into the path of a rapidly advancing Oscar and so inviting the Brazilian to smash it home. He did so with ease. It enabled Chelsea to stroll through the second half, even if there was a moment when Costa and Williams threatened to become embroiled in an ugly exchange. But it remained a game without controversy and without much of a fight from the hosts. With one eye on Tuesday’s League Cup encounter at Liverpool, Mourinho eventually made changes. But a fifth Chelsea goal, scored in the 79th minute, still came, with Eden Hazard and Ivanovic inviting Schurrle to compound Swansea’s misery from close range.

After the sale was completed, the salesman took me and a friend to the car to show me how to operate the different functions in the car.  Specifically, when he was discussing the radio I noticed there was no clock or radio display shown and when I inquired about setting the time for the clock display his answer was for me to refer to the owner's manual and he also said the display wouldn't show what radio station I was listening to.  Well, during the couple days I had for the money back guarantee I took the car to another place for an inspection and there were a number of things that needed work on the car including a weak battery, both lower control arm bushings, a leaking oil pan, and shaft seals needed repair.  Not to mention, the radio/clock display was in fact broken and the salesman couldn't just say that but rather dodged my question about setting the clock time by telling me to refer to my owner's manual, really?! Of course I went back here and showed them the list of things that already need to be done on the car and in between chuckling/laughing at how other places just want money he said since these things weren't safety hazards the car was good as is.  Sure, the car looks nice on the outside but it's already costed me $700 and I've only had the car a little over a month.  I went back not to have any work done but to pick up some paperwork and inquire about the situation and one of the service guys said he would have a talk with the particular salesman who sold me the car because that isn't the way you sell a vehicle according to him.

              " 'A bond is a debt instrument. Entities issue bonds to raise money for a specific purpose. Governments issue bonds to raise capital for public projects, like a road or a bridge. Corporations issue bonds to raise money to expand their businesses.  All of the features of a bond are stated in the bond indenture. Bonds are usually issued in multiples of a $1,000. Assume, for example, that IBM issues a $1,000,000 6% bond due in 10 years. The bond pays interest semi-annually. $1,000,000 is the face amount or principal amount of the bond. That is the amount that must be repaid by the issuer at maturity. IBM (the issuer) must repay the $1,000,000 to the investors at the end of 10 years. The bond matures in 10 years. The bond pays interest of ($1,000,000 multiplied by 6%), or $60,000 per year. Since the bond pays interest semiannually, the issuer must make two payments of $30,000 each. Using the same example, keep in mind that dozens of investors may buy a portion of the $1,000,000 bond issue. Each investor will be paid interest twice per year. An investor will also receive their original investment (principal or face amount) when the bond reaches the maturity date.  Many retired people buy bonds because of the predictable stream of income from the interest payments. All bonds are rated, based on their ability to pay interest and repay principal on a timely basis. A bond with a higher rating is considered a safer investment due to the collateral securing the bond and/or the financial strength of the issuer. All things being equal, lower rated bonds generally pay a higher rate of interest since they have greater risk of default. Assume that IBM and Acme Corporation both issue a bond due in 10 years. IBM has a high credit rating and offers a 6% interest rate. If Acme has a lower rating, the company will have to offer a rate higher than 6% to attract investors. To compute the value of a bond at any point in time, you add the present value of the interest payments plus the present value of the principal you receive at maturity.  Present value adjusts the value of a future payment into today’s dollars. Say, for example, that you expect to receive $100 in 5 years. To find out what the $100 payment is worth today, you would compute the present value of $100. The dollar amount is discounted by a rate of return over the period. This rate of return is often called the discount rate. An investor can select the discount rate using several different approaches. The discount rate may be your estimate of the rate of inflation over the remaining life of the bond. Your discount rate may also be a minimum expected rate of return. The minimum expectation is based on the bond’s credit rating, and the interest rate paid by bonds of similar quality. Assume that you decide on a 4% discount rate for the $100 payment due in 5 years. The discount rate is used to discount (reduce) the value of your future payments into today’s dollars. In this case, you’re calculating the present value of a single sum of money. You can find present value tables on the Internet, or simply use an online present value calculator. If you use a table, you will locate the present value factor for a 4% discount rate for 5 years. That factor is .822. The present value of $100 is ($100 X .822 = $82.20). The present value of your bond is (present value of all interest payments) + (present value of principal repayment at maturity).',\n",

Discarded old sofas, wooden pallets and industrial waste have all been dumped on a stretch of council-owned land opposite Purfleet Railway Station in Thurrock, Essex. The site has been occupied by travellers on three separate occasions since July, with the latest camp being moved on by the Essex Countywide Traveller Unit in October. Scroll down for video. The mile-long fly tipping site on council-owned land which stretches towards the Dartford Crossing in Purfleet, Essex. The stretch of land near to the railway line in Purfleet where the old rubbish 'appeared overnight after being dumped. The site had been occupied by travellers on three separate occasions with the latest encampment being moved on from the area last month. The dump takes 20 minutes to walk from end to end, and stretches along the railway line towards the Dartford Crossing. Thurrock Council, who believe that the site was broken into by fly-tippers, say they are unable to clean up the rubbish until it is assessed by the Environment Agency. The agency has been called in  amid fears it could contain toxic waste, including deadly asbestos among the dumped clothes, kitchen cupboards, office chairs and fridges. The dump, which takes 20 minutes to walk from end to end, is next to the railway line opposite Purfleet station on a public footpath close to an empty industrial estate. Thurrock MP Jackie Doyle-Price says she believes the fly-tipping has been caused by illegal travellers and has slammed the delays in the clean up process. The Conservative MP tweeted: 'See what travellers left behind at Cory's Wharf - bit more than household waste. 'Council taxpayers will be footing the bill to clean this up. 'All agencies failing to take prompt action.' Thurrock Council\\xa0claim the site was securely locked and was broken into by fly-tippers who dumped the rubbish. It is expected that the bill to clean-up all the rubbish could be as much as £1millio, with a local councillor describing it as 'fly-tipping on an industrial scale' The Essex Countywide Traveller Unit confirmed there had been three separate encampments on the site with the latest being moved on last month. Thurrock MP Jackie Doyle-Price says she believes the fly-tipping has been caused by illegal travellers and has slammed the delays in the clean up process. It is estimated that the bill to clean up the rubbish dump could be up to £1million with illegal travellers being blamed for the mess. Among the rubbish that has been discarded are old sofas, wooden pallets and industrial waste on the site opposite Purfleet Railway Station. Clothes can also been seen strewn across the mile-long rubbish heap. The Environment Agency are now assessing the site for toxic waste. Meanwhile Oliver Gerrish, a local Labour councillor, described the fly-tipping as ‘dumping on an industrial scale’. He added: 'It’s certainly something I would like to see the council deal with, but it’s horrendous we’re in this situation in the first place. 'It’s absolutely disgraceful that people would dump that much. 'This mess sends out an important message to landowners to keep their land secure.' A London commuter, who uses Purfleet railway station, agreed saying: 'It’s a real eye sore. An armchair sits on top of a pile of rubbish at the site, which stretches for a mile-long on land opposite Purfleet railway station. Local Conservative MP Jackie Doyle-Price has called on Thurrock Council and other agencies to take prompt action in cleaning up the waste. Bags of rubbish are left dumped alongside household waste and other items such as wooden pallets and furniture. 'The rubbish just seemed to appear overnight. 'I’ve been told it all started with travellers dumping on the site. 'I’ve never seen fly-tipping on such a huge scale and done so quickly. 'It stretches as far as the eye can see - I can’t believe the council are just letting it happen.'

A spokesman for the local authority said: 'We are amazed and appalled at how quickly this appeared and want to make clear we and the Environment Agency will examine the waste carefully.

'There have been three separate encampments on this land on three separate occasions between July and October.

The assault killed 12 and left 58 wounded. \\n  \\n Meanwhile, President Barack Obama flew to Colorado for a few hours to comfort residents in a state that\\'s critical to the November election. He began his visit with the family members of the victims at the University of Colorado Hospital, which treated 23 of the people injured; 10 remain there, seven hurt critically. The hospital is a short drive from the site of the shooting. \\n  \\n After meeting with the families, he said that he was there \"not as president but as a father and a husband.\" \\n  \\n He said that \"we can all understand what it would be to have someone taken from us in this fashion.\" \\n  \\n Holmes was being held in solitary confinement at a Denver-area county detention facility, Aurora Police Chief Dan Oates said, and is \"lawyered up.\" \\n  \\n \"He\\'s not talking to us,\" the chief said. He is scheduled for an initial hearing Monday at 9:30 a.m. MDT, and has been assigned a public defender. \\n  \\n Police have said that Holmes began buying guns at Denver-area stores nearly two months before Friday\\'s shooting and that he received at least 50 packages in four months at his home and at school. Also on Sunday, a gun range owner east of Denver said he recently rejected a membership application from Holmes in part because of a bizarre voice mail greeting on Holmes\\' phone. \\n  \\n While the University of Colorado disclosed that it was cooperating with police in the case, that disclosure was one of the few the university has made three days after the massacre. It remained unclear whether Holmes\\' professors and other students at his 35-student Ph.D. program noticed anything unusual about his behavior. \\n  \\n His reasons for quitting the program in June, just a year into the five- to seven-year program, also remained a mystery. \\n  \\n Holmes recently took an intense, three-part oral exam that marks the end of the first year. Those who do well continue with their studies and shift to full-time research, while those who don\\'t do well meet with advisers and discuss their options, including retaking the exam. University officials would not say if he passed, citing privacy concerns. \\n  \\n The university said Holmes gave no reason for his withdrawal, a decision he made in June. \\n  \\n Holmes was not allowed access from the institution after his withdrawal, which was \"standard operating procedure\" because he was no longer affiliated with the school, Montgomery said. Holmes had no contact with university police, she said. \\n  \\n The university declined to release any details of his academic record, citing privacy concerns, and at least two dozen professors and other staff declined to speak with The Associated Press. Some said they were instructed not to talk publicly about Holmes in a blanket email sent to university employees. \\n  \\n Jacque Montgomery, a spokeswoman for the University of Colorado medical school, said that police have told the school to not talk about Holmes. The university also took down the website for its graduate neuroscience program on Saturday. \\n  \\n Dan Keeney, president of DPK Public Relations in Dallas, said asking for silence from university employees because of a police investigation was appropriate, but taking down the website was \"indefensible\" for a publicly funded university unless the school believed it contained inaccurate information relating to the program. \\n  \\n \"It\\'s an indefensible action,\" he said. \"It\\'s disappointing to hear that they would take that action because it suggests that it\\'s not in the public\\'s interest to have access to that information and I think it is in the public\\'s interest.\" \\n  \\n Amid the continuing investigation of Holmes and his background, Sunday was a day for healing and remembrance in Aurora, with President Barack Obama arriving to visit with families of the victims and a vigil that began in the early evening. \\n  \\n Obama said he told the families of the victims of Friday\\'s massacre that \"all of America and much of the world is thinking about them.\" He met with them at the University of Colorado Hospital in Aurora, which treated 23 of the people injured in the mass shooting; 10 remain there, seven hurt critically. \\n  \\n Congregations across Colorado prayed for the shooting victims and their relatives. Churches sent out social-media appeals for neighbors who wanted to join in remembrance. Elderly churchgoers at an aging Presbyterian church within walking distance near Holmes\\' apartment joined in prayer, though none had ever met him. \\n  \\n Hundreds gathered for prayers and healing at the vigil Sunday night. Aurora resident Heather Lebedoff, 24, placed a rose on each cross that had been erected in memory of those killed. She said she didn\\'t know anyone in the theater, but she felt connected to her neighbors and all the pain they have gone through. \\n  \\n \"This is the city I live in, and I know there are a lot of people affected by this. Stuff like this really shows what love and community is all about.\" \\n  \\n Meanwhile, the owner of a gun range told the AP that Holmes applied to join the club last month but never became a member because of his behavior and a \"bizarre\" message on his voice mail. \\n  \\n He emailed an application to join the Lead Valley Range in Byers on June 25 in which he said he was not a user of illegal drugs or a convicted felon, said owner Glenn Rotkovich. When Rotkovich called to invite him to a mandatory orientation the following week, he said he heard a message on Holmes\\' voice mail that was \"bizarre _ guttural, freakish at best.\" \\n  \\n He left two other messages but eventually told his staff to watch out for Holmes at the July 1 orientation and not to accept him into the club, Rotkovich said. \\n  \\n Ritchie Duong, a friend who has known Holmes for more than a decade, told the Los Angeles Times that in high school he liked to play cards and video games. They both attended undergraduate school at the University of California, Riverside, where they saw each other once a week to watch the TV show \"Lost.\" \\n  \\n Duong last saw Holmes in December when they met for dinner in Los Angeles and saw a movie together. His friend seemed fine, he told the newspaper. Academics came easily to Holmes both at high school and at the UC Riverside, Duong said. \\n  \\n \"I had one college class with him, and he didn\\'t even have to take notes or anything. He would just show up to class, sit there, and around test time he would always get an `A,\\'\" said Duong, 24. \\n  \\n The pastor for the family of the suspect also recalled a shy boy who was driven to succeed academically. \\n  \\n \"He wasn\\'t an extrovert at all. If there was any conversation, it would be because I initiated it, not because he did,\" said Jerald Borgie, senior pastor of Penasquitos Lutheran Church. Borgie said he never saw the suspect mingle with others his age at church. \\n  \\n Holmes told the pastor he wanted to attend a University of California school and pursue graduate studies. Borgie, who last spoke with Holmes about six years ago, doesn\\'t remember the suspect being more specific about his goals. \\n  \\n \"He had some goals. He wanted to succeed, he wanted to go out, and he wanted to be the best,\" Borgie said. \"He took pride in his academic abilities. A good student. He didn\\'t brag about it.\" \\n  \\n The family has belonged to the church for about 10 years, Borgie said. The suspect\\'s mother, Arlene, attends services every week and volunteers her time. \\n  \\n During the attack early Friday, Holmes set off gas canisters and used the military-style semiautomatic rifle, a shotgun and a pistol to open fire on the unsuspecting theater-goers, Oates said. Holmes had bought the weapons at local gun stores in the past two months. He recently purchased 6,000 rounds of ammunition over the Internet, the chief said. \\n  \\n The gunman\\'s semiautomatic assault rifle jammed during the attack at the Aurora movie theater, forcing him to switch to another gun with less firepower, a federal law enforcement official told The Associated Press. That malfunction and weapons switch during the shooting rampage might have saved some lives. \\n  \\n Oates said a 100-round ammunition drum was found in the theater but said he did not know whether it jammed or emptied. \\n  \\n Police have finished collecting evidence from the apartment where the Colorado shooting suspect lived, but residents are still not allowed back into the building because of chemical hazards. Aurora police said Sunday residents can retrieve personal items, but the building remains closed. \\n  \\n The shooting was the worst in the U.S. since the Nov. 5, 2009, attack at Fort Hood, Texas.

Caldwell, Eileen Sullivan and Julie Pace in Washington \\n  \\n . ||||| James Holmes, the man who allegedly killed 12 people and wounded 58 at a packed screening of the latest Batman movie, \"The Dark Knight Rises,\" applied to join a Colorado gun range last month, but was rejected by the owner, who found him \"creepy.\" \\n  \\n Glenn Rotkovich, who owns the Lead Valley Range in Byers, Colo., told ABC News that Holmes applied for membership about a month ago via email, but when Rotkovich called him to follow up, he said he got a \"bizarre,\" Batman-inspired voicemail message. \\n  \\n He told his staff not to allow Holmes into the club if he showed up for an orientation. \\n  \\n The gun range owner\\'s reaction adds to a growing portrait of the 24-year-old accused of carrying out the worst mass shooting in U.S. history, and who police say rigged his apartment with dozens of explosive devices set to go off when the door was opened. \\n  \\n The search of Holmes\\' apartment yielded a computer and a variety of Batman paraphernalia, including a poster and a mask, more evidence of his apparent obsession with the comic book hero. \\n  \\n Investigators also found 10 gallons of gasoline, which were removed from the apartment and detonated at a remote site. Images of the ensuing large fireball were captured by a media helicopter hovering above. \\n  \\n Exclusive Video of Holmes at 18 \\n  \\n Overnight, ABC News obtained exclusive video and photos of Holmes. The video, which was recorded six years ago when Holmes was 18, gives some insight into his life. \\n  \\n In the video, he is standing among his peers at a science camp held at Miramar College in San Diego talking about \"temporal illusions.\" \\n  \\n \"Over the course of the summer I\\'ve been working with a temporal illusion. It\\'s an illusion that allows you to change the past,\" Holmes said in the video. \\n  \\n He appears slightly nervous speaking to the group but also extremely intelligent. \\n  \\n This is how he was explaining his mentor\\'s shared interest in fantasy versus reality in the video: \"He also studies subjective experience, which is what takes places inside the mind as opposed to the external world. I\\'ve carried on his work in dealing with subjective experience.\" \\n  \\n By most accounts, Holmes lived the life of a normal teen -- with a particular interest in science. \\n  \\n The video shows him being introduced at the seminar as someone whose \"goals are to become a researcher and to make scientific discoveries. In personal life, he enjoys playing soccer and strategy games and his dream is to own a slurpee machine.\" \\n  \\n Though Holmes was apparently a gifted scientist who had received a federal grant to work on his Ph.D. at one of the most competitive neuroscience programs in the country, he was a loner who -- oddly for a young student -- seemed to have no Internet presence. \\n  \\n Holmes Began Amassing Weapons Two Months Ago \\n  \\n On Saturday, officials said they have \"evidence of calculation and deliberation\" in the way Holmes allegedly planned and prepared for the shooting, beginning to buy weapons and ammunition two months ago. \\n  \\n Aurora Police Chief Daniel Oates announced Friday that Holmes had purchased four guns at local shops and more than 6,000 rounds of ammunition on the Internet in the past 60 days. \\n  \\n Holmes received deliveries to the school and his home over that period, police said. \\n  \\n Holmes was enrolled in a neuroscience graduate program at the University of Colorado. On Sunday, officials at the school\\'s Anschutz Medical Campus said they are looking into whether Holmes had items delivered to the school. \\n  \\n \"We are cooperating fully with the police investigation. It was mentioned yesterday that deliveries may have come to his work. That is being looked into,\" university spokeswoman Jacque Montgomery said. \\n  \\n The shooting began shortly after midnight Friday, at a soldout showing of \"The Dark Knight Rises.\" Law enforcement officials tell ABC News that Holmes purchased a ticket, entered the theater and left through an emergency exit shortly after the movie started. He geared up with body armor and guns and returned to the theater. \\n  \\n Dressed in full riot gear, Holmes allegedly re-entered from an emergency exit in the front right corner of the theater before releasing something that witnesses identify as tear gas or a smoke bomb. \\n  \\n One theory from law enforcement officials is that Holmes began shooting with his Remington shotgun, which may have been loaded with a type of bird shot. \\n  \\n When he emptied that, he then likely switched to his Smith and Wesson .223 with a drum magazine holding as many as 100 rounds, law enforcement officials said. The rounds from this rifle are the ones which are believed to have penetrated the walls of the theater. \\n  \\n When this assault rifle jammed, officials believe Holmes transitioned to his next firearm, a Glock .40 calibre with an extended clip with a 40-round capacity. Several of these clips were recovered in the theater. \\n  \\n The first three firearms were recovered in the theater. The fourth gun was found in his car after he was confronted by police. \\n  \\n Click here to read about those who died in the shooting. \\n  \\n Holmes, 24, is currently in custody at Arapahoe County Jail. \\n  \\n Some recently released inmates from the jail said Holmes is not likely to get a warm welcome from the other prisoners. \\n  \\n \"They\\'re paying really close attention to keeping him separate,\" Steven Phillips, who was recently released from there, told ABC News. \"He\\'s in red, he\\'s in chains, his arms are chained up in like a jacket. When he came in, they said he had a bullet proof vest on over his clothes so somebody wouldn\\'t stab him.\" \\n  \\n Phillips heard that Holmes is being kept in 23-hour lockdown, one of the most protected types of confinement. He is given one hour outside his cell per day to shower and use the phone. \\n  \\n Jacob Wesson, also recently released from Arapahoe County Jail, said that because Holmes is a murder who killed children, if he was kept with other inmates, they would hurt him. \"He wouldn\\'t last,\" Wesson said. \\n  \\n Inside James Holmes\\' Apartment \\n  \\n New pictures emerged overnight of several explosions in a Colorado field where investigators took chemical materials recovered from Holmes\\' apartment. \\n  \\n Crews reportedly transported the materials by dump truck to the field so that they could be ignited -- and determined if they were in fact explosives. \\n  \\n Federal authorities and local police have now pulled all of the potential explosives from Holmes\\' apartment after gaining entry and eliminating potentially explosive traps Saturday. \\n  \\n The 800-square-foot apartment contained several trip wires rigged to trigger explosions, police said. \\n  \\n Scattered throughout the living room were 30 explosive devices -- including jars with chemicals and 30 shells with explosive powder -- similar to large fireworks, police said. \\n  \\n Bomb squads carefully neutralized the two main threats at the entrance of his apartment using a \"water shot\" and remote-controlled robot. \\n  \\n Oates said the suspect\\'s intentions were clear. \\n  \\n \"What we\\'re seeing here is some evidence of calculation and deliberation,\" Oates said. \\n  \\n Click here to read \"Who Is James Holmes?\" |||||',\n",

One 8-year-old girl says the shooter shot her father before shooting her in the leg while other men were present, holding lights. A woman whose husband was killed during the incident says there were up to 20 Americans pointing their guns at her. Hakim—who says US investigators tried to prevent her from speaking to child survivors—also spoke to the Afghan general whom President Hamid Karzai has assigned to investigate the killings.

              " \"A seven-year-old boy battling brain cancer sacrificed his life to save his mother's by giving her his kidney. Chen Xiaotian was just five when doctors found a malignant tumour in his brain, months before his mother Zhou Lu, 34, contracted kidney disease. Despite early signs he would recover, the disease aggressively returned, and he was told he would not reach adulthood. Tragic: Zhou Lu, 34, reads to her terminally ill son Chen Xiatian, seven, who went blind with brain cancer. Decision: Zhou battled chronic kidney disease for two years before her son said 'I want to save you' The pair battled through together for two years. Eventually, Chen told his mother: 'I want to save your life'. Over time, both had become incredibly weak. Zhou needed dialysis treatment, while Chen required round-the-clock care. Towards the end, Chen lost his sight and became so weak he was bed-ridden, nearly paralysed. Before: The pair were inseparable and battled through their debilitating illnesses together for two years. Diagnosed: Chen was told he had a brain tumour aged five and despite early signs of recovery, it came back. Zhou grew increasingly weak, and needed a kidney transplant to survive, and Chen wouldn't let her refuse his. Grandma Lu Yuanxiu, 57, said: 'The doctors approached me rather than his mother because of the sensitive nature of the issue. 'They told me that my grandson would not survive but his kidneys could help his mother and also save two other lives as well. 'I discussed it with Zhou and she refused point-blank, she absolutely didn't want to hear any talk of that happening.' The little boy, who became near-paralysed towards the end of his life, said his wish was to help Zhou. Distraught: Zhou, pictured after her operation, said her only consolation was knowing that, if her son had to die, a part of him would always be with her. But Chen overheard the dilemma, and demanded that his mother let him save her. In tears, his mother agreed, saying that if her son was to die her only consolation was that part of him would live on in her. Doctors confirmed that the tissue match was perfect and when he died on April 2, he was quickly moved to the operating theatre where his kidneys and liver were removed and then donated to his mother and two other people. Grandma Lu Yuanxiu, 57, was the first person doctors approached to say they would have to make the decision. Doctors had not been sure Zhou would be able to live a normal life, but they say early results show Chen's kidney will give her a miracle recovery. The second kidney went to a 21-year-old girl and his liver to a 27-year-old man. Hospital spokesman Yi Tai said all three transplants were a success and that the youngster's death had allowed three others to survive and live normal lives. He said: 'The medical team held a brief moment of prayer and silence for the poor child before the transplant, I think it's fair to say there were very few dry eyes.'\",\n",

In Tulsa police helicopter footage that was among several clips released Monday showing the shooting of 40-year-old Terence Crutcher and its aftermath, a man in the helicopter that arrives above the scene as Crutcher walks to the vehicle can been heard saying \"time for a Taser.\" He then says: \"That looks like a bad dude, too. Probably on something.\" Crutcher\\'s family, the ACLU, and dozens of protesters are calling for the immediate arrest of Officer Betty Shelby, who allegedly fired the fatal shot, the AP reports. Police Chief Chuck Jordan announced before the video and audio recordings\\' release that Crutcher had no weapon on him or in his SUV when he was shot Friday. It\\'s not clear from the footage what led Shelby to draw her gun or what orders officers might have given Crutcher.

              " \"What a fun movie! If you're a Giallo fan, Red Queen Kills 7 Times is a real winner. To begin with, it's hard to go wrong with Barbara Bouchet and Marina Malfatti in the same Giallo. Both are wonderful - especially the wide-eyed innocent Bouchet as the guilt ridden woman fearing for her life. The kill scenes in Red Queen Kills 7 Times are especially nice and feature enough blood to make most fans happy. One of the first murders comes rather unexpectedly and really gets the movie off to a good start. The killer, The Red Queen, is one of the most over-the-top and interesting looking murderers I've seen in an Italian movie. The 70s sets and fashions are wonderful. In fact, all the visuals are interesting with the laughing Red Queen running across the bridge at night being one of my favorite moments in the film. The convoluted plot held my interest throughout. Finally, Bruno Nicolai's score may be the best I've heard from the composer. The main theme is so memorable I haven't been able to get it out of my head for two days.\\n\\nThe only two issues I have with Red Queen Kills 7 Times come in the film's finale. First, the person responsible for the murders is far too easy to spot. If you've seen more than a couple Gialli, you won't have any problem determining who is behind the killings. Second, the ending feels a little too rushed and, as a result, is a bit confusing. I'm definitely not one who needs every plot point spelled out to me, but I'll admit to being at a loss to explain it all. A second viewing might just clear this up.\",\n",

              " \"By. Marie-louise Olson. 'Useful and funny':The cover of the new 2014 Old Farmer's Almanac publication which was released on Tuesday. Brace yourselves for a freezing winter. At least, that is according to the Old Farmer’s Almanac. The 222-year-old periodical, which is believed to be the oldest continuously published periodical in the US, has predicted 'colder-than-average temperatures' this winter with 'higher-than-average snowfall'. The Dublin, New Hampshire-based Almanac, which released its 2014 edition today, says a drop in solar activity and a change in ocean patterns are the reasons behind the cooler temperatures. ‘This winter will bring bitter cold and heavy snow across most of the US,’ says the publication, which dubs itself as 'useful, with a pleasant degree of humour'. It. says the cold weather will affect every region of the US except for the. lower Great Lakes, the upper Midwest and the northern states of the. Northeast. ‘Sweaters. and snow shovels should be unpacked early and kept close by throughout. the season,’ said Janice Stillman, editor of the annual periodical. Shovel time: The Old Farmer's Almanac editor, Janice Stillman, says 'sweaters and shovels should be unpacked early' this year. Snowy winter: The periodical suggests people should 'gather your jackets' to brace for the extreme temperatures. Snowball fun: There will be enough of the white stuff to keep any child occupied this winter. Success rate: The publication claims its predictions are correct based on its forecast for last year's winter. Cause of chaos: A drop in solar activity and a change in ocean patterns will be the cause of the extreme temperatures, according to the periodical. The Old Farmer's Almanac has also predicted the country will experience a warmer, drier spring with above-average temperatures. It warns that drought will be a ‘problem’ during summer in several areas, such as the southern tip of Florida; from New England westward through the Lower Lakes and Upper Midwest; from Texas and Oklahoma westward through the Desert Southwest; and in the upper Pacific Northwest. The periodical also claims there will be more rainfall than normal with an ‘active hurricane season’. It predicts a major hurricane will make landfall on the central Gulf coast in July and several hurricanes and tropical storms will threaten Florida and the Atlantic seaboard in September next year. Hurricane season: The publication predicts several tropical storms will threaten the country in September. Same, same: The Farmers' Almanac, which is 197 years old, has predicted a winter outlook for 2014 much the same as its older cousin's. Last month, the Maine-based Farmers' Almanac, which has been published for 197 years, said much the same. However, some scientists have refuted the two periodicals' meteorologic assessments. Pennsylvania State University. meteorologist Paul Knight said that the Farmers' Almanac makes forecasts, which are so. vague that it is difficult to assess whether they are accurate or not. In a report published on the university's news website, Mr Knight states: 'The ability to predict events that far in advance is zero. There's no proven skill, there's no technique that's agreed upon in science to be able to do that. In its bicentennial edition, the Almanac stated, 'neither we nor anyone else has as yet gained sufficient insight into the mysteries of the universe to predict weather with anything resembling total accuracy.' However, according to the new 2014 edition of the Old Farmer’s Almanac, their forecast for last year’s winter was ‘nearly perfect’. ‘We were correct in our forecast temperature change from the previous winter in 15 of the 16 regions – yielding an accuracy rate greater than 94 per cent.’ And therefore, Old Farmer’s Almanac leaves its advice, as a chilling reminder: ‘Gather your jackets and light up a fire! It is going to be cold outside!’\",\n",

This was my son’s health and nourishment.\" In her post, Martinez says she balances motherhood with a job that involves travel by pumping whenever she can—in public bathrooms, conference rooms, closets, you name it. Here the Californian had amassed a big block of frozen breast milk while traveling without her infant on an eight-city, 15-day business trip through Europe, where four countries had already allowed the milk to pass, the Sun reports. Seems airport security at Heathrow\\'s Terminal 5 went by the letter of Department for Transport rules, which set the liquid-size limit at roughly 3.4 ounces unless the passenger is boarding with a baby, the BBC reports. Martinez\\'s argument: More than 300 ounces of her 500-ounce milk supply was frozen, not liquid, and she was willing to put it in checked luggage.

Martinez says she begged, pleaded, and even cried \"out of sheer shock and desperation,\" to no avail. \"Beyond literally taking food from my child’s mouth, you humiliated me and made me feel completely defeated as a professional and a mother.\" Heathrow says it was only following British law.

To narrow the field into two key groups—\"one full of mid-twenties arty types and one full of slightly older professional creative women,\" explains BuzzFeed—he employed, of course, an algorithm originally designed to analyze soybean crops. It\\'s uber-complicated and might even be laughable except for the fact that McKinlay—on his 88th first date—finally met Christine Tien Wang, a 28-year-old artist. They are now engaged. “I think that what I did is just a slightly more algorithmic, large-scale, and machine-learning-based version of what everyone does on the site,\" he says.

              " \"When you really miss someone, it’s hard to resist the temptation of texting them every second of the day. But if you do, they don’t really have a chance to miss you. Put your phone on silent, so that you don’t hear it buzz when the person texts you. That way you will take a bit longer to respond. You can also leave your phone at home when you go out with your friends, or turn it off when you’re about to watch a movie. Taking breaks from your phone will mean that the other person has a chance to reach out to you first, and you won’t text back quite so fast. If you’re in the habit of posting every minute of your life on social media, try easing up a bit. They’ll miss you more when they don’t know what you’re doing every minute of the day. Also avoid liking and commenting too much on their posts. For your own sanity, try to resist endlessly scrolling through their social media accounts. If you can’t resist, at least don’t leave a tell-tale trail of likes and comments behind you. If you get a new haircut, or a cute new outfit, send a picture to your special someone, and it will make them miss you. This is an especially powerful tactic for long-distance romantic relationships. If you want to make it less obvious, send a picture of you hanging out with your friends, and say what a fun adventure you had. Just make sure you look cute in the picture! Don’t wait for the conversation to fizzle out or the other person to hang up because they have somewhere to be. Instead, end the phone call by saying you’ve loved talking with them, but you have somewhere to go. Make it clear that you still care about the person by ending on a positive note, but still leave them wanting more by initiating the goodbyes. When you speak to someone before meeting up again, make a promise to do something special together. Then they’ll have something to actively look forward to and they’ll be eager to see you again. Consider keeping the actual event a secret. Simply say that you have plans for when you meet up, but don't go into too much detail. The element of surprise should increase the anticipation and the other person's eagerness to see you.\",\n",

              " 'Offer to do things with your friend more often and change the nature of your time together. Rather than interacting like casual friends the way you always have, show more of an interest in them, mentally and physically. Getting out of the friend zone is often as simple as shifting the way your friend views you and your dynamic together. The more time you spend one-on-one, the more of your true feelings you’ll be able to show them.  A good way to get more face time with the person you’re interested in is to single them out. The next time you’re hanging out with your friends, engage him or her in a private one-on-one conversation, or diverge from the group so that just the two of you can do some activity together. Invite your friend to do things you know they enjoy, like attending a concert, going on a hike or playing a sport together. Don’t expect a lengthy friendship to turn into a passionate romance overnight. Give the other person time to relax and update their perspective. Go on a few casual non-dates at first, then ask for a more formal date when the time is right. Let your gestures gradually become more flirty and playful, and escalate to more obvious affection later on. If you push too much right away, you might just end up scaring them off.  It can be hard to find a good way to start flirting that isn’t awkward. Try paying the friend you’re interested in genuine compliments from time to time, dropping hints about the things you like about their appearance and personality. Eventually, they’ll begin to see your comments in a new light. Learn to interpret your friend’s behavior. If they respond well to lighthearted flirting, it could be a good sign. If they tend to shut down or change the subject when you show affection, then they probably aren’t interested in you in that way, and it\\'s time to find a new crush. If there is someone else who you also like, then you might consider pursuing this person instead. Doing this may give you a chance to process your feelings about a friend while also allowing you to have a romantic relationship. Try to identify someone who is not a friend and who you think might be a good match for you. Look for someone who shares your interests and someone to whom you are genuinely attracted.   Don’t pretend to like someone else just to make your friend jealous. If you do start showing an interest in someone else, make sure that it is authentic. Keep in mind that if your friend is interested in you, then your new relationship might cause them to act jealous. Just make sure that this is not your goal in pursuing someone else. Small, physical gestures are a building block of deeper intimacy. Try being more hands-on with your interest. Grab his arm suddenly while telling an exciting story, or place your hand on the small of her back when she’s walking through the door ahead of you. This kind of subtle contact can awaken arousing feelings in your interest and may create a desire for more.  Increase physical contact with your friend slowly, and be respectful. See if they respond positively. Not everyone likes being touched, and you may end up sending the wrong message if you act presumptuously or put your hands somewhere they shouldn’t be. Stop right away, and consider apologizing, if you accidentally make them uncomfortable. One of the major differences between friends and lovers is that lovers tend to touch each other in more flirtatious, suggestive ways. When you introduce a more intimate level of contact with your friend, it will naturally influence the way they view you and your relationship. Whether you’ve grown tired of biding your time or you’re just not one to beat around the bush, you may prefer to announce your feelings directly to your friend. This isn’t always a bad idea. Find a time when you can sit down with your friend one-on-one and talk things out. Be heartfelt as you explain yourself, but try not to make them feel uncomfortable. Let them know that you don\\'t expect them to change the nature of your friendship, but that you had to get your feelings off your chest. Getting it out in the open will put to rest any doubt in their mind, and give you a clear answer about whether or not there’s a chance of being together as something more than friends.  Try saying something like, \"I\\'m nervous about telling you this but I feel...\" or  \"We\\'ve spent so much time together and I like being around you. I have feelings for you and ...\" Your friend might be experiencing a similar dilemma but be hesitant to act on it because they don’t sense that you’re interested. If you can work up the nerve to be honest, you have a better chance of receiving a straightforward answer, which can save you from having to agonize about the situation for weeks and weeks.',\n",

Cinema was one of his biggest passions (he penned a vast worldwide dictionary of films) and so he was bound to wield a camera at least one time in his life. But the films he left garnered lukewarm reviews: \"Tiré à Part\" (1996) in spite of Terence Stamp\\'s sensational performance was very caricatured in the depiction of the characters, \"une Affaire De Goût\" (2000) was a slick affair even if Bernard Giraudeau delivered a perverse performance, \"Pas Si Grave\" (2003) was another let-down and \"un Petit Jeu Sans Conséquence\" is as underwhelming as its predecessors. Its comic potential is exploited in a flimsy way.\\n\\nAnd however, the starting idea let predict a twirling, spiritual comedy.

Hosni Mubarak will be released from jail this week, his lawyer tells Reuters, after Egypt\\'s judiciary nullified a corruption charge against the frail 85-year-old. Pending the dismissal of another corruption charge, Mubarak is free to roam the streets. \"He should be freed by the end of the week,\" says the lawyer; a judicial source says that figure is more like two weeks. Though Mubarak faces a retrial for the killing of protesters in 2011, the AP reports he cannot continue to be held in custody because of a two-year limit pending a final verdict. Elsewhere on the ground: Some 25 police officers have been massacred as Islamic militants in the Sinai peninsula—where attacks on security forces have soared since Mohamed Morsi was removed from office last month—ambushed a pair of minibuses carrying the officers and killed them execution-style in broad daylight, the AP reports. The Egyptian government says 36 detainees captured in recent days died after clashes with police, Reuters reports. Officials say the detainees, part of a convoy headed to a prison, rioted and captured a police officer. When tear gas was fired into a police van in an attempt to free the officer, the men suffocated. The Muslim Brotherhood says the incident was murder and the death toll was higher than the government admits. As European Union leaders met to discuss the crisis—and consider halting aid to Egypt—Britain\\'s foreign minister gave a bleak assessment.

Prime Minister David Cameron has ordered an investigation into official papers which suggest the Thatcher government helped India plan an attack against Sikh separatists in the Golden Temple. The 1984 raid on Sikhism's holiest shrine at\\xa0 Amritsar angered Sikhs around the world who accused the Indian army of desecration. The death toll remains disputed, with the Indian authorities putting it in the hundreds and Sikh groups in the thousands. The assault triggered the assassination of Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, who ordered the attack, when two Sikh bodyguards killed her in revenge several months later. Attack: The Golden Temple at Amritsar, India, was attacked in 1984. Newly-released British government papers suggest then-PM Margaret Thatcher responded positively to an Indian government request for advice on planning the attack and sent an officer from the elite SAS special air service to help draw up a plan. Today, Downing Street said Mr Cameron has now ordered an investigation by top civil servant Jeremy Heywood. The Prime Minister's official spokesman said: 'These events led to a tragic loss of life and we understand the very legitimate concerns that these papers will raise. 'The Prime Minister has asked the Cabinet Secretary to look into this case urgently and establish the facts.' Mr Cameron and Foreign Secretary. William Hague had been unaware of the papers prior to their. publication, the spokesman added. Syed Akbaruddin, a spokesman for India's foreign ministry, said his government was only aware of the story from the media. 'We will take it up with our UK counterparts and seek more information,' he said. The assault triggered the assassination. of Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi (pictured right with Thatcher on a visit to India), who ordered the attack, when two. Sikh bodyguards killed her in revenge several months later. Hundreds died in the raid by the Indian army on the temple in June 1984, and in October that year the country's prime minister, Indira Gandhi, was assassinated by two Sikh bodyguards in an apparent act of revenge. The papers, released under the 30-year rule and published on the Stop Deportations blog, indicate that Mrs Thatcher was aware of the involvement of an SAS officer in drawing up a plan - although it is not clear whether the Indian army operation followed this advice. The request for British advice is disclosed in a letter, dated February 23 1984, from Brian Fall, private secretary to then foreign secretary Geoffrey Howe, to Hugh Taylor, his counterpart under home secretary Leon Brittan. The letter said: 'The Indian authorities recently sought British advice over a plan to remove Sikh extremists from the Golden Temple in Amritsar. 'The Foreign Secretary decided to respond favourably to the Indian request and, with the Prime Minister's agreement, an SAD (sic) officer has visited India and drawn up a plan which has been approved by Mrs Gandhi. The Foreign Secretary believes that the Indian Government may put the plan into operation shortly.' David Cameron visited the Sikh Shrine Golden temple in Amritsar on last year. Last year Mr Cameron visited the site of what he called the British Empire's most ‘monstrous’ atrocity. The. Prime Minister echoed the words of Winston Churchill as he paid tribute. to the 379 innocent Indians slaughtered in the Amritsar massacre. Mr. Cameron concluded his visit to India with a trip to the. Golden Temple, the holiest site for Sikhs, and the Jallianwala Bagh. gardens – where soldiers under Brigadier Reginald Dyer fired 1,650 shots. into a crowd of 20,000 unarmed protesters in 1919. Mr Cameron called the killings ‘deeply shameful’ but stopped short of giving an explicit apology for the massacre.\",\n",

The prospect of their own annihilation when it inevitably winds up in the minority is enough to cool passions.\\n\\nSen. Mitch McConnell (Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg)\\n\\nIt was hardly a stunner then when Senate Democrats and Republicans reached a deal today to avoid the nuclear option. The Post reports: “The Senate dodged a constitutional showdown Tuesday with a bipartisan pact to confirm several nominees to run agencies overseeing Wall Street and labor relations, stopping the Democratic effort to change filibuster rules on a party-line vote that threatened to turn the chamber’s already chilled partisan tensions into a deep freeze.” It was pretty much a clean win for the GOP. (“Republicans won their demand for different Democratic nominees for the National Labor Relations Board, but gave assurances of a speedy confirmation that would make the board fully operational by next month.”)\\n\\nAs one senior GOP adviser put it, “They preserve the right to go nuclear; the GOP preserves the right to filibuster.” It did not go unnoticed that Majority Leader Harry Reid’s bluff had been called. The Associated Press observed:\\n\\nUnder the current proposal, Obama would drop efforts to win confirmation for two members of the National Labor Relations Board and name two replacements who would receive speedy consideration. Richard Griffin and Sharon Block were originally named to their posts as recess appointees, meaning they bypassed confirmation. An appeals court has since ruled their appointments were invalid, and the Supreme Court has agreed to review the case.\\n\\nThe proposed agreement would not resolve deep partisan divisions over the future use of filibusters to block a president’s executive nominees. . . . If ratified, the deal would mark a retreat by Reid from his insistence on Monday that Republicans promise not to filibuster future executive nominees.\\n\\nI can imagine the announcement over the weekend that former Montana governor Brian Schweitzer (D) would not seek to replace Max Baucus, who is retiring, was a timely reminder: Today’s majority is tomorrow’s minority.',\n",

              " 'The Kentucky State Fair has its share of eye-popping choices:. *Deep fried Kool-Aid. *The Donut Burger, a heart-stopping marriage of Krispy Kreme and quarter pounder. *And this year, at the 50th annual Farm Bureau Country Ham Breakfast, a have to see it to believe it pairing: former foes Mitch McConnell and Rand Paul side by side, all smiles, eager to prove the Republican establishment and the tea party cannot only coexist, but can be allies. It wasn\\'t too long ago that Paul, a freshman senator, was a thorn in McConnell\\'s side -- defeating the Senate Republican leader\\'s candidate of choice in the 2010 primary season that helped put the tea party on the map. As Paul surged late in that campaign, McConnell cut an ad for his choice, Kentucky\\'s then-secretary of state. \"I know Trey Grayson and trust him. We need Trey\\'s conservative leadership to help turn back the Obama agenda,\" McConnell said in the spot. Fast forward three years, and what you see is an awkward alliance that is in part the product of painful lessons McConnell has learned in recent years as tea party backed insurgents have knocked off GOP establishment figures in primaries, including one of McConnell\\'s best friends in the Senate, Robert Bennett of Utah. At the State Fair event, McConnell delivered a forceful rebuke of President Barack Obama\\'s health care plan. \"The solution to Obamacare is to pull it out root and branch.\" McConnell told the breakfast moment\\'s after Kentucky\\'s Democratic governor praised the plan. McConnell, though, opposes a tea party backed plan to risk a government shutdown if that is what it takes to deny the president the funding necessary to implement the health care program. It is one of the issues highlighted by McConnell\\'s tea party backed primary opponent, businessman Matt Bevin. And one of the issues where Team Mitch, as his campaign calls itself, hopes having tea party favorite Paul in his corner helps blunt Bevin\\'s appeal. Bevin lands conservative endorsement. \"I think it is a dumb idea to shut down the government,\" Paul said in response to a question from CNN as he and McConnell met with reporters recently at the fair. The Bevin challenge is a case study in Tea Party 101. The litany of familiar complaints against the establishment rattled off in one early Bevin TV ad:. \"McConnell has voted for higher taxes, bailouts, debt ceiling increases, congressional pay raises, and liberal judges.\" Bevin\\'s chances likely depend on some big outside help, and some of the conservative groups who make their names taking on the GOP establishment are dipping their toes into the race now to get a sense of whether McConnell is truly vulnerable. \"Career Washington politician Mitch McConnell claims to be a conservative,\" is the opening line of one recent radio ad paid for by the Madison Project. The Kentucky primary is May 20, and given the early bruising tone, plus McConnell\\'s national profile, there is no doubt this contest will shatter state spending records for Senate races. The matchup here is one of several testing the standing of veteran, establishment Republicans. GOP Sens. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, for example, are bracing for potentially tough challenges. Liz Cheney is running against incumbent GOP Sen. Mike Enzi in Wyoming. McConnell\\'s campaign recently released its own polling showing a more than 40 point lead over Bevin. But he is running as if scared, mindful of the tea party surprises these past two election cycles. McConnell is already spending on TV ads, painting Bevin as a political opportunist. \"Bevins\\' company failed to pay taxes, then got a taxpayer bailout. Bailout Bevin, not a Kentucky conservative,\" blares one. Another focuses on a Bevin resume that appeared to suggest he graduated from Massachusetts Institute of Technology when, in reality, he participated in a short MIT seminar program for which all recipients received a certificate. \"Newspapers say Bevin was dishonest about his resume -- claiming to graduate from prestigious MIT,\" this McConnell ad declares. \"Not true.\" McConnell hits opponent over LinkedIn profile. Some see evidence of McConnell\\'s caution in the Syria debate now front and center in Congress. Of the four top leaders in Congress, McConnell is alone in not supporting the president\\'s call for military strikes: GOP House Speaker John Boehner, House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid are all on record backing action. McConnell issued a statement Tuesday saying he was still undecided. \"Congress and our constituents would all benefit from knowing more about what it is he thinks needs to be done â€” and can be accomplished â€” in Syria and the region,\" the GOP leader said after a White House meeting with the president. McConnell aides say his caution has nothing to do with the campaign. But Bevin is on record opposing military strikes against Syria, as is Paul -- and to take a position at odds with his primary rival and new ally would instantly make the Syria debate a campaign flashpoint. Paul to Obama: Don\\'t rush into war in Syria. Democrats were already on record promising to make McConnell a top 2014 target, even though Kentucky hasn\\'t elected a Democrat to the Senate since Wendell Ford won his last six-year term in 1992. Reid predicts McConnell loss. Secretary of State Alison Grimes is well aware of the history, and using her early months of the campaign to try to make the case she would be no rubber stamp for Obama. \"We have had trouble in our state identifying with the national Democratic Party,\" Grimes said in an interview. \"I will tell you I am running as a Kentuckian. ... I have my disagreements with the president.\" Chief among them, she says, is an energy policy she called anti-coal. Grimes also favors changes to the health care law, but says it has many admirable pieces that should be kept. She is campaigning, at least for now, as someone who expects McConnell to survive the primary challenge. \"It\\'s about ending the disease of dysfunction that we have seen in Washington, D.C.,\" she says of her campaign. \"And after nearly 30 years, Senator McConnell is at the center of it. He is to blame for the failed leadership.\" McConnell\\'s team labels Grimes as too liberal for the state and suggests the president\\'s standing here would be a major drag. But the incumbent himself prefers not to deliver direct blows, just yet, leaving that, for the most part, to his team and TV ads. \"I like a good campaign,\" McConnell said after the fair breakfast. \"We are going to have a lot of fun.\"',\n",

              " \"By. John Hall. A debut novelist whose work was rejected by publishers for a decade has won one of the world's top literary awards. Irish author Eimear McBride, 37, beat heavyweights including American Pulitzer Prize-winning novelist Donna Tartt to win the £30,000 Women's Prize for Fiction at a ceremony in central London. Her novel 'A Girl Is A Half-Formed Thing' was written 10 years ago but was rejected as too experimental by every publisher who read it, until a small company in McBride's hometown of Norwich finally agreed to release it last year. Recognition: 'A Girl Is A Half-Formed Thing' by Eimear McBride (pictured) was rejected by publishers for 10 years. Yesterday the novel won the £30,000 Women's Prize for Fiction at a ceremony in central London. The novel, which is the story of a young woman's relationship with her brother and the long shadow cast by his childhood brain tumour, was written in just six months in 2004. After being rejected by every publisher she sent it to, McBride decided to put the novel away until last year when Norwich-based independent publisher Gallery Beggar Press agreed it must be published. The company paid McBride a £600 advance for what was only the second book it had ever released, with 'A Girl Is A Half-Formed Thing' later picked up by Faber & Faber, who gave it a wider audience. The book has been critically acclaimed since its release, winning the inaugural Goldsmiths Prize last year and narrowly losing out on the The Folio Prize in March to American writer George Saunders. Speaking yesterday, Helen Fraser, who chaired the Women's Prize for Fiction judging panel, said: 'An amazing and ambitious first novel that. impressed the judges with its inventiveness and energy. This is an. extraordinary new voice - this novel will move and astonish the reader.' Stiff competition: Eimear McBride beat a number of acclaimed authors, including previous winner Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie (left) and American Pulitzer Prize-winning novelist Donna Tartt (right) Ms McBride, who was born in Liverpool but grew up Sligo and Mayo in Ireland, collected her prize at an awards ceremony at the Royal Festival Hall in London. She beat a number of acclaimed authors including a previous winner, Nigerian novelist Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, who was nominated for 'Americanah'. Jonathan Ruppin, web editor for Foyles bookshop, said: 'To paraphrase Brian Eno's legendary quote about the first Velvet Underground album, not many people have bought it so far but every single one of them will probably write a novel.' 'It's bold, brilliant and beautiful, a book that will delight every reader concerned that the novel had nowhere new to go and reinforce every prejudice of those who dismiss literary fiction as pretentious.'

              " '– It\\'s not exactly the most romantic statistic: Almost half of all men finish sex within two minutes, reports the New Republic by way of Dr. Harry Fisch\\'s new book, The New Naked: The Ultimate Sex Education for Grown-Ups. In an excerpt published on Nerve, Fisch notes that his patients are typically fixed on what the normal frequency of sex should be, but that quality—and therefore duration—should be of equal concern. He trots out statistics from previous sex studies to that end: that the length of the average sex act is 7.3 minutes, but an \"astonishing\" 43% of such acts are completed within 2 minutes. This isn\\'t exactly breaking news. Alfred Kinsey determined decades ago that the majority of men ejaculated in 2 minutes or less. (Interestingly enough, a sex therapist recently defined intercourse lasting fewer than 2 minutes as premature ejaculation to the Daily Mail.) But the New Republic points out that men, not women, are probably more likely to be most bothered by the figure. A 2004 study found that men reported a significantly longer ideal duration of intercourse than did women; both sexes had similar ideas about the ideal foreplay length. So what\\'s a guy to do, other than get over it? A Swedish study offers one interesting course of action: Researchers had men who couldn\\'t make it more than a minute complete 12 weeks of pelvic floor exercises; their average ejaculation time rose nearly five-fold, from 31.7 seconds to 146.2 seconds, reports UPI.',\n",

When David Knapp found out his son-in-law was set to pick up an eBay purchase from the home\\xa0 where he was raised by his own parents, he was intrigued enough to go along for the ride. But the grandfather's curiosity turned to astonishment when the bungalow's owner, after learning of his history in the house, handed him a bracelet his late mother Emily had lost decades earlier. The 66-year-old grandfather-of-six admitted he was overwhelmed to be presented with the silver trinket stamped with his mother's initials - that he didn't even know she had lost. What are the chances? David Knapp, 66, holds up the silver bracelet which belonged to his mother that he was reunited with after a chance encounter with the new owner of his childhood home. Mr Knapp's parents lived at the bungalow in Costock, Nottinghamshire, which was built by his grandfather, after they got married in 1936 until they sold it and moved to Nottingham in 1985. 'It's overwhelming to be honest,' Mr Knapp said. 'The owners held up a bracelet which they said they found while they were gardening outside the bedroom window. 'The bracelet had the initials ER on it. My mother's maiden name was Richards and her first name was Emily. 'I must admit I didn't even know mum had the bracelet, let alone lost it, until I was shown it.' Blast from the past: Mr Knapp's mother Emily,. centre, to whom the bracelet belonged, with his father Douglas, left, and. sister Susan, right, pictured in the garden of the home in Costock,. Nottinghamshire. How it looked then: Mr Knapp's parents lived at. the bungalow, which was built by his. grandfather, after they got married in 1936, raised there children there and remained until they sold it and moved. to Nottingham in 1985. Mr Knapp grew up at the property with his two sisters and lived there until he got married when he was 28-years-old. So he was already stunned when his son-in-law Andrew told him that he had to visit the property to pick up a sofa that he'd bid for an the auction site eBay. And the retired computer worker had another shock when the owner of the bungalow gave him a silver bracelet which his mother had lost. 'I think it must be her engagement bracelet because there's a shape of a heart on it,' he added. 'Mum must have lost the bracelet when I was very young, probably while she was gardening. 'We'll keep it. It's of more sentimental value than monetary value.' Heirloom: Mr Knapp says he'll keep the bracelet, which he thinks must have been given to his mother as an engagement present because it has a heart on it. The bracelet's finder Annie Sherman, who has since moved out of the bungalow, said she was delighted she was able to reunite the jewellery with its owner. She said: 'I dug it up while I was making a flower bed and I kept it because I thought it was rather sweet. 'I had a lump in my throat when I gave him the bracelet. It's now back with its rightful owners.'\",\n",

As part of a settlement in a $100 million defamation lawsuit brought by exiled Chinese businessman Guo Wengui, Stone has admitted using the conspiracy website InfoWars to spread false statements, the Wall Street Journal reports. Stone accused Guo of being a \"turncoat criminal who is convicted of crimes here and in China\" and claimed he had made illegal campaign donations to Hillary Clinton. Stone, who won\\'t be required to pay damages if he retracts the statements, described his behavior as \"irresponsible.\" Stone also claimed Guo was financing a White House bid by former Trump strategist Steve Bannon, NBC reports.

The research built upon previous studies indicating a specific set of brain cells in the amygdala become activated when a person drinks to excess. For the study, scientists at the Scripps Research Institute deactivated those brain cells—and the rats ceased their heavy drinking for the entire length of the study, about two weeks. They also suffered only minimal withdrawal symptoms. \"We\\'ve never seen an effect that strong,\" George says. \"It\\'s like [the rats] forgot they were dependent.\" Just to make sure, the researchers ran the experiment several times, each time with the same results. An interesting side note: When the neurons were shut off in rats who were considered binge-drinkers but not fully addicted, the effect lasted just a day, \"as if the brain’s path from alcohol to reward was not established yet.\" More studies will need to be carried out to see how this finding translates to human alcohol dependency.

Then, to top off our order, we had some Euro Fries that were covered with pork belly bacon, herbs, cheese, and garlic mayo.

He tried it out because one of the staff had suggested it and said that it was pretty good. The fries were pretty tasty. They were a little on the salty side, not because of the toppings, but I think because of the seasoning salt that was on the fries themselves.

              " '– St. Jerome was said to have been painted by an Italian Renaissance master and was displayed at Vienna\\'s national gallery before it was sold at auction in 2012 for $842,500. The buyer apparently overpaid. Sotheby\\'s now says the artwork is a fake, not painted by Parmigianino in the 16th century but by a forger within the last 100 years, reports NPR. Before its sale, some had suspected St. Jerome was painted by an associate of Parmigianino, but all agreed it was 400 years old. When research lab Orion Analytical revealed a $10 million Dutch painting supposedly by Frans Hals to be a fake in October, however, it put all other artworks connected to the same dealer into question, including two others that turned out to be fakes, per ArtNet and the Art Newspaper. The dealer, Giuliano Ruffini, had also owned St. Jerome. A technical analysis by Orion Analytical\\'s researchers found 21 areas of the painting contained the synthetic green pigment phthalocyanine green. It was \"first used in paints nearly four centuries after Parmigianino died\" and was not the result of a restoration, according to Sotheby\\'s complaint. Sotheby\\'s is now demanding St. Jerome\\'s consignor, Lionel de Saint Donat-Pourrieres, repay $672,000 he received from the 2012 sale. Meanwhile, Ruffini—who is under investigation in France but has not been charged with a crime, per the New York Times—says he has his doubts about the St. Jerome analysis, citing \"experts and curators from the Metropolitan Museum\" who vouched for its age.

              " 'Young children with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are roughly four times more likely than their peers to become depressed or attempt suicide in later childhood, a new study suggests. Researchers followed 125 children with ADHD for up to 14 years beginning at ages 4 to 6, and compared them with a similar group of children without ADHD. Thirty-nine percent of the children with ADHD were also found to have depression during the study period, versus 8 percent in the control group. The risk for depression increased if the child demonstrated symptoms and behaviors that are distinct from -- but often occur alongside -- ADHD, such as anxiety, defiance, hostility, bullying, and fighting. The risk for depression was also more pronounced if the child\\'s mother had a history of depression. Health.com: How to recognize the symptoms of depression. \"The only children with ADHD who were not at increased risk for depression were those without a depressed mother and who exhibited very few symptoms of other types of mental health problems,\" says the senior author of the study, Benjamin Lahey, Ph.D., a psychologist and professor of epidemiology at the University of Chicago. \"That is only a small proportion of children with ADHD.\" ADHD also increased the risk of suicide attempts. Roughly 18 percent of the kids with ADHD attempted suicide at least once during the study, compared with 6 percent of the kids in the control group. (None were successful, fortunately.) Children who were primarily hyperactive and impulsive appeared to be at greatest risk, which suggests that impulsivity may play a role in suicidal behavior, the researchers say. Girls were at greater risk than boys for both depression and suicide attempts, but there weren\\'t enough girls in the study to draw firm conclusions about gender, according to the authors. Health.com: How to spot the warning signs of suicide. The study appears in the Archives of General Psychiatry. ADHD is estimated to affect 4.4 million children in the U.S. and has been shown to raise the risk for academic and social difficulties, employment problems, and even brushes with the law later in life. However, this study is the first to examine the risk factors for depression in very young children with ADHD, and the first to follow children for an extended period of time. Experts have long suspected an ADHD-depression link in childhood, but the research to date has been inconclusive. \"This study adds more data to the notion that early manifestations of hyperactivity and impulsivity...are not necessarily benign,\" says Dr. Benedetto Vitiello, M.D., chief of the research branch dedicated to child and adolescent treatment and prevention at the National Institute of Mental Health, which funded the study. Health.com: Quiz: Do you have adult ADHD? But the children in the study aren\\'t necessarily typical of all children with ADHD, says Rafael Klorman, Ph.D., a professor of psychology at the University of Rochester Medical Center, in New York. It\\'s relatively uncommon for ADHD to be identified in children as young as 4, he explains, and kids who get a diagnosis at that age tend to have more severe symptoms. \"These kids were diagnosed earlier, which means that the researchers have a sample with especially higher severity,\" Klorman says. \"They may be getting the high end of the spectrum.\" Parents should not \"panic and think their children with ADHD are destined for depression or suicide,\" Lahey says. However, he adds, if parents are concerned that their child is showing symptoms of ADHD or depression, they should consult a mental health professional and consider family therapy. Health.com: What if my child begins to exhibit symptoms of ADHD? More research is needed to identify effective interventions that can lower the chances of depression in high-risk kids with ADHD, Vitiello says, echoing Lahey and his colleagues. Early intervention and treatment are important, as the risk of depression and other health problems associated with ADHD can last well into adulthood. Previous studies have estimated that anywhere from 16 percent to 37 percent of adults with ADHD have been diagnosed with major depressive disorder or dysthymia, a milder form of depression. And in another new study, which appears in the Archives of Pediatric & Adolescent Medicine, researchers at New York University report that teenagers with ADHD are about twice as likely to have problems with alcohol and drugs in their 30s than those without the disorder. Health.com: Adult ADHD and substance use. However, the risk seems mainly due to the overlap between ADHD and conduct disorder, a related condition that\\'s characterized by physical aggression and delinquent behavior, such as stealing and vandalism. The teens who did not show signs of conduct disorder did not appear to be at increased risk for substance abuse, the study found.

              " 'The stake in Safaricom is being sold by Vodafone as part of its drive to streamline its African businesses.\\nThe deal will extend the South African firm\\'s influence in Kenya.\\nIt will also help increase the use of Safaricom\\'s popular M-Pesa money transfer service across Africa.\\nM-Pesa, launched 10 years ago in Kenya by Safaricom, lets people without bank accounts use their mobile phones to transfer money.\\nHowever the tie-up comes just a year after Vodacom dropped M-Pesa in South Africa after it failed to prove popular with consumers.\\nThat failure was largely attributed to the fact that possessing a conventional bank account is much more common there than in the rest of the continent.\\nM-Pesa is now available in Albania and Romania, as well as Democratic Republic of Congo, Egypt, Ghana, India, Lesotho, Mozambique and Tanzania.\\nBy Matthew Davies, editor, BBC Africa Business Report\\nIt\\'s a family affair. While, at $2.59bn, this is a significant deal, the money actually stays in the Vodafone family. Vodacom of South Africa will buy up 87.5% of Vodafone Kenya, which means it gets 35% of Safaricom.\\nVodafone International gets 226.8 million new ordinary shares in Vodacom, which will increase Vodafone\\'s stake in Vodacom from 65% to 70%. The ultimate aim is to spread Safaricom\\'s highly successful M-Pesa financial payment platform beyond Kenya.\\nEven though 10-year old M-Pesa has 26m customers, most are in Kenya. It was scrapped in South Africa last year, because of poor uptake figures. But that was because M-Pesa does better in markets that are less developed in terms of formal banking. So, Vodacom will be planning to introduce it to many of its 66.8m African subscribers.\\nBut it won\\'t be all done and dusted behind closed doors at the Vodafone family mansion. The deal still has to be approved by regulators and minority shareholders in South Africa and Kenya.\\nThe South African government owns a 14% slice of Vodacom and Kenya\\'s regulators could decide that the deal breaches an ownership threshold that would make it compulsory for Vodacom to make a bid for Safaricom as a whole.\\nThe deal represents a big reshuffle of its African interests for the UK-based international phone company Vodafone, which owns 40% of Safaricom and also 65% of Vodacom.\\nThe deal will be effected by Vodafone transferring a 35% stake in Safaricom to Vodacom, in exchange for Vodafone being given new shares in Vodacom worth $2.6bn.\\nAll this will leave Vodafone with a raised 70% stake in Vodacom, and a much reduced 5% stake in Safaricom. The Kenyan government will retain its 35% stake in Safaricom.\\nSibonginkosi Nyanga, an analyst at Momentum S.P. Reid, said the deal was likely to create value for Vodacom shareholders.\\n\"Kenya is one of the leading countries when it comes to technology growth, so it presents quite a number of opportunities for a company like Vodacom.\"\\nSafaricom is Kenya\\'s biggest and most profitable company and last week reported an 18% rise in annual profit to $470m.\\nIts chief executive, Bob Collymore, said it would continue to have a strong Kenyan representation at its board and management levels.',\n",

              " \"– According to Michael A. Ochoa's wife, the 46-year-old had hoped to spend the wee hours of April 25 engaged in a foursome with his wife and another couple at a San Antonio hotel. Instead, he ended up dead, after falling 18 stories from his hotel balcony. Police last week released a report on the incident, which remains somewhat murky, in part because Ochoa's wife told them three distinct stories. What they do know is that when they arrived around 2am, she was crying, scratched, and missing a fingernail; video of the second couple exiting the Hilton Palacio del Rio indicated they weren't obviously injured, the San Antonio Express-News reports. What went down, version one: Ochoa's unnamed wife agreed to the four-way sex, then changed her mind when the other couple showed up; they left, Ochoa started assaulting her; then he walked outside and vanished. In version two, Ochoa got in a fight with a member of the other couple; both that person and Ochoa punched Ochoa's wife when she tried to break it up. Again, the other couple left, Ochoa went outside, and she never saw him again. Version three is essentially version one, except with Ochoa's wife saying her husband went to the balcony in order to flee security, who knocked on their door. Those guards were the ones who spotted Ochoa, who KSAT describes as an area real estate agent, in the river below; police say his wife didn't realize he fell or died, and they documented no signs of struggle on the balcony.

I'm not quite sure what it was called, but i know it was $18.00. I also ordered the Vegas Fries as an appetizer for our table to share.  The fries were nothing special. They are wedge cut and come with some sort of ranch dressing on the side. I really only ordered them because I LOVE bleu cheese.   As soon as I bit into my burger, I told everyone sitting with me that the burger was not good. It was extremely dry and the meat was soooo thick it was hard to chew and even harder to swallow.   Anywho, I did not like the burger but I ate it anyway because I was starving. I couldn't finish it because it was soooo dry. So I left a little less than half. I was completely unsatisfied but I did not care enough to send it back.   We paid and went on our merry way to enjoy our last night in Sin City. I got back to the room and a few hours later I had to run to the bathroom to throw everything up. I'm sorry if this is too much info but it's what happened. I threw up 4 times and all 4 times it was the hamburger patty and the bleu cheese. It was the worst feeling ever. And then a little something else hit me, but I won't mention that. Around my eye area, I saw that I was starting to develop these little red dots all over and a little above my forehead. It had to have been an allergic reaction to the bad meat. Now I thought it was just me, but that morning when we were heading down to valet, one of the girls who was in our party but staying in a different hotel told me she threw up 3 times and it was ALL of the burger. She had the same burger as I did. Coincidence? I think not.   2 nights before, we had eaten at Gordon Ramsay's BURGR, and I had also ordered a burger with bleu cheese and I was perfectly fine.   I hate to base my review on my experience but I can guarantee I'll never go back because just the thought of walking by there makes me sick to my stomach.   I had to catch a flight back and I was terrified of not making it to the bathroom in time in case it hit me again.   I will say this, even before I got sick, I did not like the taste of any of the food.   Sorry for the TMI but I just needed to get this out there.\",\n",

New research in the Lancet finds patients who undergo morning heart surgery are twice as likely to suffer heart issues and other complications as patients who have surgery in the afternoon, per the BBC. It\\'s not that doctors are drowsy in the morning and therefore prone to mistakes. Rather, researchers say the body\\'s circadian rhythm regulates genes that are in top form and better able to handle stress in the afternoon, a fact that also explains why one\\'s risk of heart attack is highest in the morning. To discover this, researchers conducted several studies, one monitoring 596 patients who underwent an aortic valve replacement, half in the morning, half in the afternoon. After 17 months, they found 18% of morning patients had suffered a major adverse cardiac event, acute heart failure, cardiovascular death, or a heart attack during the operation, compared to 9% of afternoon patients. Morning patients also had twice the risk of other complications, per the study, which identified 287 genes linking the body clock to heart health, reports the Independent. A second study also found morning patients had significantly higher levels of troponin, a measure of heart damage, per the New York Times. This doesn\\'t mean morning surgeries should be avoided, but \"we should identify patients at high risk for complications—those with diabetes or other metabolic risks, for example—and operate on those in the afternoon,\" a study author tells the Times.',\n",

Instead, the Republican representative was just another face in the political crowd on Monday and suffered the indignity of being loudly booed as he left the Capitol building in Washington D.C. The former VP hopeful said last week that we would attend the swearing-in ceremony of President Obama because it was his 'obligation'. Scroll down for video. Unimpressed: Republican representative Paul Ryan was booed as he attended Obama's inauguration on the West Front of the U.S. Capitol today. Lost the race: Ryan attends Obama's ceremonial swearing-in at the Capitol on Monday. The Congressman appeared to take the boos in his stride, conveying little reaction to the crowd's negative response during an otherwise upbeat day. According to conservative blog Red State, the booing was started by Dan Freeman, an attorney who works at the Department of Justice. Ryan earlier wrote a gracious message on his Facebook page where he addressed Obama's inauguration directly. He wrote: 'I congratulate President Obama on his inauguration, and I join the country in celebrating this American tradition. The president and I were political opponents. We had strong disagreements over the direction of the country - as we still do now. But today, we put those disagreements aside. Today, we remember what we share in common. 'We serve the same country, one that is still in need of repair - and is still the freest on earth. 'We serve alongside men and women from. both parties, who govern in good faith and good will. Finally, we serve. the same people, who have honored us with their charge. Defeated: Paul Ryan appeared with Republican colleagues to watch one-time rivals for the White House Barack Obama and Joe Biden being sworn in. Absence: Former presidential hopeful Mitt Romney was nowhere to be seen today and was believed to be at his family home in La Jolla, California. We may disagree on matters of policy. But today we remember why we take those matters so seriously - because we seek the public good. It’s our highest duty - one that we share - and one for which we’re grateful. I’m happy to mark this historic occasion - for the president and for the country. And I look forward to tackling the big challenges ahead.' Ryan's running mate Mitt Romney was. not at the inaugural ceremony on Monday. He was 3,000 miles from. Washington at his home in La Jolla, California with his family. Whether he watched the day's historic days is debatable although one former aide said it would be 'doubtful'. Second term: Barack Obama is sworn in as the 44th President of the United States today as wife Michelle and daughter Sasha and Malia look on. Pride: Joe Biden is sworn in as Vice-President today at the Capitol in D.C. The President savored his special day as hundreds of thousands of supporters gathered to witness his second inauguration, grinning as he waved enthusiastically to the crowds lining Pennsylvania Avenue. And in a moving display of his appreciation as he left his public swearing-in ceremony at the Capitol building early on Monday afternoon, he was seen pausing a moment to look back towards the crowds and reflect on the vast sea of people before him. 'I want to look out one more time because I'm not going to see this again,' he said quietly to someone next to him as he took in the spectacular view. Obama was sworn into office by Chief Justice John G. Roberts as the president's proud wife Michelle and two daughters, 11-year-old Sasha and 14-year-old Malia, looked on.

              " 'Iran, Syria and now China. President Barack Obama faces a third front of vulnerability on his administration\\'s record of defending human rights with the muddled situation involving activist Chen Guangcheng. With his re-election campaign just hitting full stride, Obama hoped to capitalize on foreign policy successes, such as last year\\'s raid that killed Osama bin Laden, to blunt Republican attacks on the sluggish U.S. economic recovery. However, the increasingly strange and challenging case of Chen provides potential fresh fodder for opponents to continue their attempts to portray the Obama presidency as soft or acquiescing to brutal regimes that abuse their own people. Presumptive Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney led the attack Thursday, saying at a campaign event that circumstances of the incident -- if true -- meant a \"dark day for freedom, and it\\'s a day of shame for the Obama administration.\" Conservative Republicans such as Sen. John McCain of Arizona have criticized the Obama administration for not providing strong support for Iranian protesters last year or the Syrian opposition movement in its ongoing conflict with forces of President Bashar al-Assad. \"Ultimately, ending violations of conscience requires the political will and moral courage of world leaders, especially the president of the United States,\" McCain said last week. \"Unfortunately, that will and leadership are lacking in the case of Syria today.\" Chen\\'s case casts new light on China\\'s history of political persecution and rights abuses and comes at a particularly delicate time as U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner arrived this week for long-planned talks on strategic and economic issues. Chen: \\'I want to go to the United States\\' The blind, self-taught human rights attorney has been persecuted by Chinese authorities for years for his work exposing the government\\'s policy restricting the number of children a couple may have, mistreatment of disabled people and other abuses. He escaped from house arrest last month and took refuge in the U.S. Embassy in Beijing, setting off a behind-the-scenes diplomatic effort intended to prevent the situation from derailing the top-level meetings with Clinton and Geithner. On Wednesday, all seemed resolved when the 40-year-old Chen left the embassy to join his family at a Beijing hospital, with U.S. officials saying that he never requested asylum and that China gave assurances that he and his family would not face further persecution. That quickly unraveled at the hospital, where Chen said he wanted U.S. help to flee China with his family because he feared for their safety. The situation has tested the Obama administration\\'s approach to relations with China, straining its commitment to uphold human rights even as it strives to maintain steady ties with Beijing. Last week, when Chen was still inside the embassy, U.S. officials refused to confirm his location and Obama declined to comment directly on the case when asked about it at a news conference. In comments Thursday at the high-level talks with China, Clinton made no mention of Chen while saying the topic of human rights was part of the discussion. A senior State Department official said Thursday the United States will do what it can to help Chen and his family leave China if they want to, but added that Washington doesn\\'t have \"a magic wand\" to get him out of the country. At the White House, press secretary Jay Carney referred questions about the situation in China to the State Department. Carney repeated details previously released by State Department officials that Chen never asked for asylum while in the U.S. Embassy and was never pressured to leave. Romney, however, said news reports indicated that U.S. officials may have sped up Chen\\'s decision to leave the embassy \"because they wanted to move on to a series of discussions that Mr. Geithner and our secretary of state are planning on having with China.\" He also complained that the embassy failed to put in place \"the kind of verifiable measures that would assure the safety of Mr. Chen and his family.\" \"We are a place of freedom here and around the world, and we should stand up and defend freedom wherever it is under attack,\" Romney said. Ben LaBolt, spokesman for the Obama campaign, said Romney\\'s Thursday comments rang hollow. \"He has no coherent foreign policy vision, no concrete plans to enhance our security and strengthen our alliances, and he has taken conflicting positions on every major foreign policy issue facing our nation,\" LaBolt said in a statement. \"Rather than leveling these empty political attacks at the President, Mitt Romney should tell the American people exactly what he would do as commander in chief.\" A statement by House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, said that \"the United States has an obligation to stand with the oppressed, not with the oppressor.\" \"Having handed Chen Guangcheng back over to the Chinese government, the Obama administration is responsible for ensuring his safety,\" Boehner\\'s statement said. \"While our economic relationship with China is important and vital to the future of people in both countries, the United States has an obligation to use its engagement with China to press for reforms in China\\'s human rights practices, particularly with respect to the reprehensible \\'one-child\\' policy.\" Human rights groups and some members of Congress are pressuring the Obama administration to help Chen and his family get out. Noting the presence of Clinton in China for the talks, Republican Rep. Chris Smith of New Jersey called for the Obama administration to do \"everything it can to ensure that Chen Guangcheng, his family members and all those who have helped him are removed from harm\\'s way.\" \"They must seize this golden opportunity to help save Chen and his family and demonstrate to the world that the (United States) stands firm for fundamental human rights and the rule of law,\" said Smith, the chairman of the Congressional-Executive Commission on China. \"Trade talks are important, but human rights are not \\'an irritant\\' -- we have a duty to protect and defend.\" Later Thursday, Smith chaired an emergency hearing on the issue that included a telephone conversation with Chen from Beijing amplified by holding a cellular phone up to a hearing room microphone. Speaking to Chen, Smith called his case a test of the Chinese government\\'s commitment to protect him and \"also a test of the United States as to whether or not human rights really do matter.\" Carney, repeatedly asked about the issue by reporters at the White House daily briefing, said the president is \"not concerned about political back-and-forth on this issue.\" \"He is focused on the need to advance U.S. interests in our relationship with China\" and to make \"an open and frank discussion on human rights\" part of that relationship, Carney said. Human rights advocacy groups raised doubts about whether Beijing would stick to the promises it reportedly made regarding Chen\\'s ability to live free of persecution in China. Chinese officials did not comment directly on what deal had been reached with the United States over Chen. In comments reported by state media, they focused on what they described as \"interference\" by Washington in China\\'s internal affairs. To Kenneth Lieberthal, director of the John L. Thornton China Center and a senior fellow in foreign policy at the Brookings Institution, the balance of human rights issues such as the Chen case with other significant issues for both the United States and China marked a maturing of relations between the countries. \"The juxtaposition of a classic human rights issue with these other issues highlights the range of our relationship and our capacity now to do what U.S. policy has sought -- which is to deal with these issues separately so that problems in any one part of the relationship don\\'t disrupt our ability to address very important issues in other parts of the relationship,\" Lieberthal said on the Brookings website. \"That\\'s what a mature relationship is about.\" A co-author of a book on Obama\\'s foreign policy published in March, Lieberthal said the balanced approach by Washington \"does not mean, as some in the advocacy community have said, that this means that effectively we don\\'t give much priority to human rights.\" \"What it does mean is that we give priority to human rights, we give priority to nuclear proliferation, we give priority to cybersecurity, we give priority to jobs and economic growth in the United States and how China\\'s economic polices affect that,\" said Lieberthal, a former University of Michigan professor who was a special adviser on national security affairs to President Bill Clinton. \"We have a series of priorities, each of which we pursue vigorously, and I think that\\'s the right way to do it.\" Carney seemed to agree Thursday, telling reporters: \"We are continuing to pursue our broad agenda with China on a whole range of issues.\" CNN\\'s Paul Courson contributed to this report.',\n",

              " 'A satellite orbiting Earth has spotted 55 southern right whales hanging out in the shallow waters off Argentina. \\n  \\n It turns out that these particular whales are quite easy to spot from space, said Peter Fretwell of the British Antarctic Survey. They got the name right whales because they were once considered the \"right\" whales to hunt. They are large and slow, and they spend a lot of time lolling near the surface of calm ocean waters. \\n  \\n For this reason, their numbers dropped from a pre-whaling population of 55,000-70,000 to just 300 by the 1920s. \\n  \\n \"The same reason they are the right whales to catch makes them the right whales to look for by satellite,\" said Fretwell. \\n  \\n In a paper published Wednesday in the journal PLOS One, Fretwell argues that tracking the southern right whale population by satellite is not only possible but efficient. \\n  \\n The traditional way to track whale populations is standing on a bridge of a ship and looking out into the ocean, or gliding over the water in an airplane. But these methods are expensive and time-consuming, said Fretwell, and also often inaccurate. \\n  \\n \"Satellite imagery provides much more accurate and wider coverage,\" he said. \"If this works, we can take it out to many other species as well.\" \\n  \\n For this study, Fretwell and his colleagues purchased a single, massive image taken in September 2012 by the WorldView2 satellite. The image covers 70 square miles including Golfo Nuevo, a circular gulf off the Argentine coast and an area where southern right whales are known to breed and raise their young from July through November. \\n  \\n By looking at the same image in different wavelengths -- including one able to penetrate 50 feet beneath the ocean -- the researchers were able to spot 55 probable whales and 22 possible whales in the gulf as well as 13 whale-shapes underwater. \\n  \\n As you can see in the gallery above, the satellite images of whales are far from crystal clear. The authors admit that the satellite system is not perfect. After all, it is possible that a flock of birds or a large rock could be mistaken for a whale -- or that what looks like a single whale is actually a mother whale with a calf. \\n  \\n But these uncertainties should go away with time, scientists say. New satellites will have higher quality imagery and will allow scientists to identify whales with greater confidence, Fretwell and his coauthors write. \\n  \\n Scientists have already used satellite imagery to count populations of penguins in Antarctica, and Fretwell said similar work was being done with seals. The key to using satellites to track animals is not the size of the animal but how much it stands out from its environment, he said. \\n  \\n If you like whales and space, you like what I write about.

But these are necessarily narrow in scope. \\n  \\n An automated satellite search could cover a much larger area of ocean and at a fraction of the cost. \\n  \\n \"Our study is a proof of principle,\" said Peter Fretwell from the British Antarctic Survey. \\n  \\n Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Peter Fretwell: \"Blue light penetrates the water column\" \\n  \\n \"But as the resolution of the satellites increases and our image analysis improves, we should be able to monitor many more species and in other types of location. \\n  \\n \"It should be possible to do total population counts and in the future track the trajectory of those populations,\" he told the Inside Science programme on BBC Radio 4. \\n  \\n The breakthrough is in part down to the capability of the latest hi-res satellites. \\n  \\n In this study, Mr Fretwell and colleagues used DigitalGlobe\\'s WorldView-2 platform. \\n  \\n This is among the most powerful commercial Earth observation platforms in operation today, and can see surface features down to 50cm in size in its panchromatic mode (black and white). \\n  \\n Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Vicky Rowntree: \"Whales peak at Peninsula Valdes in September\" \\n  \\n The team selected as their test area a 113-sq-km segment of the Golfo Nuevo on the Peninsula Valdes, a location famed for its gatherings of calving southern right whales. \\n  \\n Even though these are large animals, they still only take up a few pixels in the satellite picture. \\n  \\n Nonetheless, a manual search of the scene found 55 probable whales, 23 possible whales and 13 sub-surface features. \\n  \\n Several automated methods where then trialled, with the best results coming from a combination of the very hi-res panchromatic view and a narrow band of wavelengths in the violet part (400-450 nanometres) of the light spectrum. \\n  \\n This coastal band, as it is known, penetrates 15m or so into the water column in good conditions. \\n  \\n The automated approach found 89% of probable whales identified in the manual count. \\n  \\n Image copyright DigitalGlobe/BAS Image caption WorldView-2 has spectral bands that allow scientists to pull out specific information in the imagery \\n  \\n Mr Fretwell cautions that there are limitations to the technique. For example, rough seas or murky waters will confound a search. But he believes, on the basis of the trial study, that satellite counting can become a very useful conservation tool. \\n  \\n \"In this type of automated analysis you have to balance two types of errors - errors where you miss whales, and errors where you misidentify whales. If you push too hard one way, like trying to catch all the whales, you\\'ll increase the number of false positives. With our 90%, we had almost no misidentifications,\" the researcher explained. \\n  \\n Southern right whales were a very appropriate target for the study. \\n  \\n These animals were driven to near-extinction in the early 20th Century. Recognised as slow, shallow swimmers, they were the \"right\" whales to hunt. \\n  \\n Their numbers have seen something of a recovery, but without the means to carry out an accurate census, it is hard to know their precise status. \\n  \\n Concern has also been raised of late because of the sightings of many dead calves in the nursery grounds around the Peninsula Valdes. \\n  \\n Prof Vicky Rowntree from the University of Utah is the director of the Ocean Alliance\\'s Southern Right Whale Program, and has spent many years studying the Valdes whales. \\n  \\n She said the new method would be a huge boon to her field of research. \\n  \\n \"It\\'s going to be absolutely amazing. The other dimension of it is that many marine mammal researchers have been killed flying in small planes while surveying whales.

              " \"A storied piece of American history is being kept away from the public as the federal government tries to cut costs during the sequester. The retired Air Force One airplane that is now holed up in a private hanger in Ohio is the same one where Jackie Kennedy stood as Lyndon Baines Johnson was sworn in, as her husband's blood was still fresh on her jacket. It is the same airplane that ferried then-President Nixon to China in his famed trip done to help smoothe tensions with the Eastern power. Historic moment: Lyndon Johnson was sworn into his presidency on board the now-retired Air Force One, with President Kennedy's wife Jacqueline standing alongside him on November 22, 1963. Foreign relations: It was also the plane that President Nixon took on his landmark visit to China in 1972. On hold: The former Air Force One, now known as SAM 26000 (pictured) is normally on display to the public at the National Museum of the United States Air Force in Ohio but it has been closed because of the sequester. And though then-Vice President Al Gore was the last one to take a significant trip on it when he marked the airplane's retirement in 1998, it had been still pleasing visitors for years as a display at the National Museum of the U.S. Air Force for years. That is until it was closed off to visitors, as CNN reports that the shuttle buses used to drive tourists to the remote hanger were seen as an excessive cost for the federally-funded enterprise. As a result, aviation aficionados will have to settle for the plethora of photos from the plane's- which is now referred to as Special Air Mission 26000, or SAM for short- it's most dramatic- and infamous- moments. The first came with the death of a President, as SAM 26000 was the plane that ferried then-President Kennedy to Dallas, Texas along with his wife on that fateful November day in 1963. Unexpected moment: Federal Judge Sarah Hughes (left corner) was called on board, making her the first female justice to swear in an American President following President Kennedy's assassination. Precious cargo: Jacqueline Kennedy escorts her husband's casket off the plane when they landed at Andrews Air Force Base, and his brother Bobby is seen at her side. Widow's walk: The President's blood could still be seen on her legs and suit when they landed. As a result of the assassination, it also became the plane that ferried his body back to Washington. Before that happened, though, it earned another distinction as it became the spot where the only female judge has sworn in a president. Federal Judge Sarah Hughes was called on board to give Johnson the oath of office before heading back to the Capitol with a heartbroken First Lady and presidential corpse on board. On hold: The former Air Force One, now known as SAM 26000 (pictured) is normally on display to the public at the National Museum of the United States Air Force in Ohio but it has been closed because of the sequester. The plane didn't finish it's funereal tasks there, as it later was used to fly the coffins of LBJ and Nixon to their final resting places, Texas and California respectively. Nixon's most memorable moment with the plane came during his lifetime, however, as he made his 1972 trip to the People's Republic of China. It was the first time that an American president visited the country, and was seen as a significant step in building diplomatic relations. Plane diplomacy: Nicon's trip to China (seen here leaving alongside his wife, then-First Lady Pat) in 1972 was the first time an American President visited the Eastern country. Touring the East: The visit came as a surprise by many, but had positive effects on the countries' relationship. On a different trip, the plane played a role- albeit a very minor one- in one of the most embarassing moments in American politics. Booby prize: After Monica Lewinsky was transferred from The White House because she was 'too close' to President Clinton, she worked at the Pentagon and went on a government trip to Europe. After becoming an intern and mistress of then-President Bill Clinton, Monica Lewinsky was transferred out of the White House and into the staff roster for the Pentagon. While she was upset that she was further away from her married lover, one perk that helped soften the blow was the fact that she was included on a Pentagon trip to Europe. As such, she rode the plane overseas, since it was used for the trip since it was getting older and relegated to second-tier activities (as opposed to being on call for the president's use). The plane's final flight came just two years later when then-Vice President Al Gore was on board for the last leg of a multi-decade tour of duty when it went from Washington to Columbia, South Carolina. 'If history itself had wings, it probably would be this very aircraft,' Gore said during the trip. Now it is a part of history being hidden away, however, as it is off limits to visitors who make the trek to Dayton, Ohio to visit the aviation history museum. Because the sequestration is still in flux, there is no telling exactly when it will be reopened to the public.\",\n",

              " 'In some cases, an off track window may be caused by a broken or worn out track. If areas in the track are rusted, apply a few drops of white lithium lubricant to them. If areas in the track are bent, try pressing them into shape using the back of a hammer, wrench, or other firm tool. If the track is rusted or bent to the point of being unusable, you will need to replace the window regulator and, most likely, the window motor. Depending on your car’s make and model, replacement regulators typically cost between $190 and $270, not including a motor. If your window track uses glue to hold the glass in place, touch it to make sure it is still sticky. If the window track is dry, rough, or cracked, squeeze a layer of Automotive Goop or similar automotive adhesive into it. Over time, a bad window motor can cause the glass pane to stop moving, making it appear off track or causing it to fall out of alignment. Check the motor for any clear signs of damage, like dents or holes. If the device seems good, connect voltmeter wires to the motor’s connector terminals. If the voltmeter reads between +12 and -12 volts, the window motor is in good working condition.   If the motor seems fine but doesn’t operate correctly, replace the associated fuse in the fuse box. If it still doesn’t work, check the window control switch by connecting an ohmmeter to it and and looking for little to no resistance when the switch is pressed.  Depending on your car’s make and model, expect replacement motors to cost between $120 and $240, not including a regulator. In some cases, a stuck or off-track window may have been caused by a loose or faulty wire. Examine each wire inside the door for kinks, tears, and other forms of damage. If they look good, make sure they’re fully connected to the window motor. If the wires are damaged or broken, you will need to replace them or, in some cases, the whole motor. Though not always available, model-specific replacement wires generally run between $15 and $50 dollars.',\n",

              " 'Not only will your purse be lighter without the change weighing it down, but you will also ensure that you actually make note of and save that change. When cleaning your car or vacuuming your sofa, check for loose change in the seats, between the cushions, or on the floor. You’ll be surprised by how much you can gather by just looking for it. Loose change can often be found on the ground in parking lots, in change slots in vending machines, and near drive-through windows. Make it a habit to check these areas for loose change, and you can add to your growing collection. If you’re looking for a hobby that can potentially help your bottom line, using a metal detector to find loose change could be for you. When you go out with your detector, practice the “low and slow” method by keeping the detector coil close to the ground and giving the machine enough time to process what’s below. Then, when you hear a beep, carefully dig and look for buried coins or other treasure.  Parks, sports fields, and beaches are popular places for metal detecting. If you want to use your detector on private property, be sure to ask permission first. Make it a habit to pay for small items in cash, and pay a whole dollar amount instead of providing change. For example, if your coffee is $4.35, pay with a $5 instead of four singles, a quarter, and a dime. The more change you create, the more change you can save. When gathering and picking up change, keep an eye out for coins that may be worth more than face value. Silver coins (like dimes and quarters) minted prior to 1965 may have enough silver in them to be worth more than the $0.10 or $0.25 you may think they’re worth.',\n",

The Foreign Service Institute offers free online language learning materials, which include audio recordings which help with learning pronunciation. The Duolingo app and BBC Languages also offer various languages and useful pronunciation tips. This is probably the most important part of the language besides the vocabulary. \"Paul want Mary go store\" may communicate an idea, but it is not at all correct English. If you do not pay attention to grammar, you can sound equally incomprehensible in another language.  Look at the structure of the language and how the articles work (masculine, feminine, neutral). Getting a handle on the structure of the language will help you understand how it fits together once you start learning different words Ensure you know how to express questions, affirmative and negative statements in the past, present and future using the 20 most common regular and irregular verbs.

The current version of Jane Austen\\'s PERSUASION shows us what happens when you don\\'t have a good foundation in a well-written adaptation. This version does not compare to the 1995 version with Amanda Root and Ciaran Hinds, which was well acted and kept the essence of the era and the constraints on the characters (with the exception of the bizarre parade & kissing in the street scene in Bath). The 2007 version shows a twitty Anne who seems angst-ridden. The other characters were not very developed which is a crime, considering how Austen could paint such wonderful characters with some carefully chosen understatements. The sequence of events that made sense in the novel were completely tossed about, and Mrs. Smith, Anne\\'s bedridden and impoverished schoolmate is walking around in Bath - - twittering away, as many of the characters seemed to do. The strength of character and the intelligence of Captain Wentworth, which caused Anne to love him in the first place, didn\\'t seem to be written into the Rupert Penry-Jones\\' Wentworth. Ciaran Hinds had more substance and was able to convey so much more with a look, than P-J was able to do with his poses. All in all, the 2007 version was a disappointment. It seemed to reduce the novel into a hand- wringing, costumed melodrama of debatable worth. If they wanted to bring our modern emotional extravagances into Austen\\'s work, they should have done what they do with adaptations of Shakespeare: adapt it to the present.

ABC News has excerpts: \"While no one can deny the considerable strength and prowess of the Islamic State group in military terms, at the same time, the crimes it has committed against Muslims cannot simply be overlooked or forgotten with time, because in Islam there is no statute of limitations.\" \"And if these wrongs are not brought to an end and rectified here in this world, then a severe punishment has been promised both for those who committed them as well as those who encouraged, condoned or justified them, even if from behind a computer or mobile phone thousands of miles away.\" \"Frankly, all of us used to be sympathetic to varying degrees towards the Islamic State of Iraq [ISIS]—despite its mistakes—when it was seen as a weak and oppressed force valiantly fighting brutal tyrannies. But now that it has become clear that it has—unfortunately—adopted some of the traits, methods and tactics of those same tyrannies, it no longer holds the same place in our hearts that it did once upon a time.\" In ABC\\'s view, Gadahn\\'s comments don\\'t jibe with other parts of the interview, where he praised the 9/11 attacks and the more recent attacks on Canada.

You may have nightmares about the supernatural and feel like something is chasing or attacking you in your sleep. Nightmares may be very vivid, to the point you can physically feel things in your dreams.  If you're experiencing things like shortness of breath during sleep, however, see a doctor. This can be a sign of a medical condition, such as sleep apnea, which should be ruled out before you attribute the issues to ghosts. Nightmares can also have psychological causes. If you've been stressed or upset lately, this may be causing your nightmares as well. Your own intuition can help guide you when evaluating whether your house is haunted. People who live in allegedly haunted homes sometimes feel like they're being watched. If you ever get a sense you're not alone, even if no one else is in the room, this can be a sign of a haunting.  If you have other people living with you, ask them if they experience the sense of being watched as well. Keep in mind, feelings of nervousness and paranoia can also be attributed to underlying mental health issues. This kind of anxiety should be evaluated by a mental health professional. Ghosts can allegedly affect personality and mood. If you or another household member becomes angry, irritable, or inexplicably sad, this may be a sign of a haunting. If negative moods tend to only surface in your home, this indicates there may be a ghost present. Low moods and irritability can be a sign of mental health issues, however. If you have a persistent low mood for a long time, see a therapist before attributing it to a haunting. Some people believe hauntings cause mild physical symptoms. For example, you may sometimes come down with small colds. Hauntings can also cause an overall feeling of weakness.  As these symptoms can be caused by a number of other ailments, however, see a doctor before attributing them to a haunting. If everyone in the house is experiencing physical symptoms, have your home investigated by professionals to check for hazards like mold and bacteria.\",\n",

Monday\\'s announcement by the track\\'s owners means the oldest venue on the F1 calendar keeps its place. Silverstone\\'s comeback took place despite rival track Donington Park being awarded the contract to host the British Grand Prix from 2010. However, that circuit lost out after failing to secure the $200 million needed to fund redevelopment plans. That had led to fears Ecclestone would look to move the race abroad. Silverstone managing director Richard Phillips told the Press Association: \"We\\'ve always had five-year deals and never been able to get the investment we needed to redevelop. \"But 17 years gives us the ability to invest and move forward. We\\'ve always had the belief the British Grand Prix was an important cornerstone of Formula One but, with Bernie, you\\'re never quite sure. Phillips described the deal as \"peace in our time\" between the circuit\\'s owners, the British Racing Drivers Club (BRDC), and Ecclestone. \"The relationship with Formula One Management has been improving,\" added Phillips. \"There\\'s a good working relationship with him now and we don\\'t have any issues.\" Applauding the negotiating team, BRDC president and 1996 F1 world champion Damon Hill told the Press Association: \"It\\'s not easy to enter into an agreement of this magnitude. It\\'s a big commitment. \"But the BRDC felt we wanted this relationship to continue, and we were prepared to back the negotiating team, with the level of risk satisfactory for the deal to go ahead. \"This announcement is tremendous news.

David Cameron today announced an additional £52 million in UK aid for victims of the civil war in Syria, as the G20 summit in St Petersburg saw stark division over the international response to allegations of chemical weapons use by the regime of President Bashar Assad. The US and France are so far the only nations attending the G20 to have backed the use of military force against the Assad regime, with Russia and China insisting that any action in the absence of UN Security Council approval would be illegal. Italian Prime Minister Enrico Letta - who also attended this morning's aid meeting - said in a tweet last night that 'the G20 has just now finished the dinner session, at which the divisions about Syria were confirmed'. A spokesman for the Russian presidency said a US strike on Syria would 'drive another nail into the coffin of international law'.

Conference: David Cameron, right, and members of his delegation walk back to their villa at the G20 Summit earlier today. Group photo: Russia's President Vladimir Putin, center front, stands with G-20 leaders during a group photo outside of the Konstantin Palace. Much of the new money will go towards. medical training and equipment to help civilians targeted by chemical. attacks, while Mr Cameron also called for international action to secure. humanitarian access to war zones. After. defeat in the House of Commons prevented Mr Cameron from joining US. President Barack Obama in preparing for military action against Assad,. the Prime Minister has sought to avoid being marginalised at St. Petersburg by putting himself at the head of a drive to persuade G20. leaders to strengthen their support for efforts to relieve the suffering. of millions of Syrians affected by the two-year civil war. The PM was yesterday forced to deny he was being sidelined, after reports that a senior aide to summit host Vladimir Putin - a long-time ally of Assad who has warned that military action without UN backing would amount to an act of aggression - had dismissed Britain as 'just a small island: no-one pays any attention to them'.

A Number 10 source said that the reported remark 'highlights how a small island with great people can achieve a big footprint in the world'. It is not known whether the alleged snub. was discussed in a 35-minute bilateral meeting between Mr Cameron and. Mr Putin which took place at 2am St Petersburg time, after the Russian. President had treated his guests to a lavish display of music and. fireworks at the Peterhof Palace. Target: Much of the new money will go towards medical training and equipment to help civilians targeted by chemical attacks. Meeting of minds: German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Italian Prime Minister Enrico Letta, US President Barack Obama and British Prime Minister David Cameron talk during the summit. Discussions: World leaders are venting over Syria's civil war but look no closer to agreeing on international military intervention to stop it. Mr Cameron announced Britain's new aid contribution - bringing the total UK funding for assistance in Syria and neighbouring states to £400 million - at a meeting he called to urge fellow leaders to dig deep to fund a 3 billion US dollar (£1.9 billion) shortfall in the United Nations appeal for Syria. Acknowledging the deep disagreements voiced when Syria was discussed at last night's official dinner, Mr Cameron said that action on aid would show that the G20 had 'a very large message' of support for the people of the war-torn Middle Eastern state. 'This is a moral imperative,' Mr Cameron. told the meeting, attended by ministers from Canada, Japan, Australia,. Saudi Arabia and Turkey and a senior official in the Obama. administration, as well as UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon and the EU's. Jose Manuel Barroso and Herman van Rompuy. 'This is the big refugee crisis of. our time. As the Secretary General has made clear, seven million people. are in dire need and chemical weapons attacks have made this even more. acute. 'A Syrian. becomes a refugee every 15 seconds while we sit here at this conference. That is 5,000 fleeing their homes and becoming homeless while we are at. this G20 summit. 'It. is also a political imperative. It will help us build international. support for action by showing that our response is not just military. At. a summit where people have focused on potential divisions over Syria, I. wanted to bring you together to identify key priorities about the. action needed to send a strong message about our commitment to the. Syrian people and the urgent priority to do more.' President Putin and President Hollande attend a meeting with Business 20 and Labour 20 representatives today. Arrival: President Putin arrives in an electric car for a meeting with the heads of BRICS member states' Reminding fellow leaders that the UN. relief appeal is so far only 43 per cent funded, Mr Cameron said: 'The. UK is the second largest bilateral donor and today we can announce an. extra 81 million dollars... We would welcome an announcement by others. to highlight our resolve to do more.' Mr. Cameron said he wanted today's meeting to begin a campaign in the weeks. ahead of the UN General Assembly to challenge the world to meet the. UN's funding appeal. He. added: 'On chemical weapons, a strong response must be about saving. lives as well as preventing future attacks. Britain's new support will. include scaling up medical response in the face of chemical attacks,. through the training of medical and civil defence teams, protective. equipment to assist decontamination and medical supplies including. antidotes and response medicine. 'I. hope we can send a strong signal that we can act, and act specifically. to relieve this appalling suffering caused by the war crime of chemical. weapons use.' President Barack Obama, and members of his delegation walks to meet with China's President Xi Jinping for a bilateral meeting. U.S. President Barack Obama speaks during his bilateral meeting with China's President Xi Jinping. Mr Cameron also called for a. 'political and diplomatic breakthrough on the problem of humanitarian. access', calling for agreement on the need for 'unfettered humanitarian. access inside Syria'. This. could include priority routes for aid convoys, humanitarian pauses in. the fighting so aid can get through, dedicated officials to resolve. problems on the ground and the lifting of bureaucratic obstacles for aid. workers. 'All of this will make a big difference to the humanitarian aid picture in Syria,' he said.'If. we can agree these three points, we will have made sure that this G20. summit - despite all the disagreements there were last night - has a. very large message on humanitarian aid.' The. US and France are so far the only nations attending the G20 to have. backed the use of military force against the Assad regime, with Russia. and China insisting that any action in the absence of UN Security. Council approval would be illegal. Italian Prime Minister Enrico Letta -. who also attended this morning's aid meeting - said in a tweet last. night that 'the G20 has just now finished the dinner session, at which. the divisions about Syria were confirmed'. US. frustrations over Russia's stance were reflected in comments by the. American envoy to the UN, Samantha Power, who told a New York news. conference: 'Even in the wake of the flagrant shattering of the. international norm against chemical weapons use, Russia continues to. hold the (Security) Council hostage and shirk its international. responsibilities. Cup of tea anyone? Russian President Vladimir Putin and Prime Minister David Cameron, warm themselves as they arrived for the Water and Music Show last night. Vladimir Putin, second right, covers Germany's Chancellor Angela Merkel warm blanket before the show starts. 'What. we have learned, what the Syrian people have learned, is that the. Security Council the world needs to deal with this crisis is not the. Security Council we have.' The Pentagon has been instructed by Obama to draw up a more extensive list of potential targets in Syria, according to the New York Times. This means expanding beyond the 50 or so. major sites that were part of the original target list developed with France. The newspaper reported that he gave. the instruction following intelligence indicating that Assad has been. moving troops and equipment used for chemical weapons. The aim would not be to strike the chemical weapons instead headquarters overseeing efforts, military units and rockets. The. US Government accuses Assad's forces of killing 1,429 people in a. poison-gas attack in a suburb of the Syrian capital, Damascus, on August. 21. Strained: Leaning tiredly on his hand, his forehead etched with tension, David Cameron cut a miserable figure during the first working session at today's G20 summit. Britain announced yesterday that scientists at the Porton Down research laboratories have found traces of the nerve gas sarin on cloth and soil samples retrieved from the site of the attack. Meanwhile, there were signs that Mr Obama may struggle to secure support in Congress for his proposal of 'limited and proportionate' military action against Assad. A poll commissioned by the BBC and ABC News suggested more than one-third of Congress members were undecided whether or not to back military action, while a majority of those who had made a decision said they would vote against the President. The survey found that 226 members of the House of Representatives said they would oppose or were likely to oppose military action, against 45 who were certain or likely to support it and 189 who were undecided or did not respond. Some 17 members of the Senate were certain or likely to oppose Mr Obama's plans, against 23 certain or likely to back him and 60 whose position was undecided or unknown.\",\n",

As taps echoes toward the District, most people have one hand on their heart and the other on their iPhone, trying to get a good photo.\\n\\nBefore laying the wreath, the students received a briefing from one of the Sentinels.\\n\\n“It was kind of scary when he first walked up, because he was so tall,” Christina Meyers says. They were soon put at ease: “He was really gentle,” Andrea Klima says. “Not like the way they are out there,” gesturing at a Sentinel sternly walking back and forth.\\n\\nNear the entrance to the Tomb Quarters, the next group of wreath-laying kids is getting instructions from a Sentinel in a polo shirt and khakis. “Look down at the stairs,” he says. “People try to look forward and they trip and fall. Don’t do that.”\\n\\nThe crowds are starting to come in; the lines on the steps are now four people deep. Carney again instructs the crowd to maintain an atmosphere of silence and respect. There are three wreath-laying ceremonies this time: three groups of teenagers with serious faces, three playings of taps.\\n\\nThe rhythm of the day is becoming clear. The crowd starts to thicken at 15 minutes before the hour. After the ceremonies it disperses, leaving behind a few dozen people who watch the guard and take the occasional picture in front of the Tomb, unsure if they should smile.\\n\\nOne of the wreath-layings this time is by Mayer Middle University, another middle school. Two boys from Gresham, Ore., honor other boys from we don’t know where. After taps, three volleys sound from elsewhere in the cemetery as someone else’s boy or girl is laid to rest.\\n\\nIn Tomb Quarters, the two Sentinel trainees might be practicing in front of a three-way mirror. Each day, they’re required to do three hours of “mirror time,” during which they spin their rifles, check their posture and stumble in private so they’re perfect in public.\\n\\nDuring their time as trainees (usually six to nine months), future Sentinels are not allowed to laugh or smile within the Quarters, except in very limited “safe zones.” They are also, in military parlance, not allowed to “acknowledge furniture.” That means they “can’t sit down, can’t touch it, and if it’s in the way, they can’t move it,” Selga says.\\n\\nIt’s still cloudy, but the Sentinels have donned sunglasses; the glare off the marble magnifies the sunshine struggling to break through. During the rifle inspection, the incoming Sentinel knocks a medal off of his chest while spinning his weapon. It hits the marble with a tiny clang that startles everyone but the Sentinels, who carry on. (After the ceremony a trainee brings the medal to the Sentinel, who steps into the guardhouse to reattach it to his uniform.)\\n\\nAt 12:03, a volley of gunshots from a full honor funeral — much louder than the rifles that have been firing all day — makes everyone jump but the Sentinels. Who carry on.\\n\\nThose who visit the Tomb between the Changing of the Guard ceremonies usually stay for less than 10 minutes: Watching a guy walk can keep one’s attention only for so long. Unless you’re the guy walking.\\n\\n“Most of your thoughts are on what you’re doing,” Selga says. That’s walking 21 steps, turning, pausing for 21 seconds (which requires a perfectly functioning internal clock), turning, pausing for another 21 seconds and walking 21 steps back. And never slouching.\\n\\n“Sometimes I’ll be thinking about something I’m doing and I’ll think about it so much the time will fly by,” Selga says.\\n\\nAs the next change approaches, a crowd of men arrives. Some are in wheelchairs and most wear caps showing when they did their military service. Their trip was paid for by the Kansas chapter of the Honor Flight Network, which sends World War II, Korean War and Vietnam War veterans on visits to D.C.\\n\\nWhen it’s time for four Kansans to lay their wreath, the crowd is a little quieter and stands a little straighter. Even though civilians aren’t supposed to salute, the foursome does anyway. No one seems to mind.\\n\\nAnother Honor Flight group, this one from York, Pa., arrives. With them is Lawrence Bocksel, a combat engineer who landed on Omaha Beach on D-Day.\\n\\n“They’re the heroes of the world,” Bocksel says, looking at the tombstones around him. “They gave everything so we could have our tomorrows.” Bocksel’s tomorrows include his two daughters, who are with him, as are his grandchildren, some of whom buzz about wearing too-big York Honor Flight T-shirts.\\n\\nOne daughter says she’s glad her dad got to travel here with other veterans, since he never talks about his experiences with anyone else.\\n\\n“It was terrible,” he says. “Terrible. But it had to be done.” He doesn’t want to say any more.\\n\\nIt’s warming up. Two more middle school groups lay wreaths. One of the wreath-layers forgets to put his hand on his heart and is quietly reminded by Staff Sgt. Brian Blackmore. Their classmates are starting to sweat beneath their D.C. and FBI sweatshirts.\\n\\nThough part of the ceremony is the inspection of the incoming guard’s uniform, what the public sees is largely ceremonial. The Sentinels are first checked in Quarters before proceeding to the Tomb. That inspection is just as rigorous as the one up top looks. The Sergeant of the Guard — the one who supervises the ceremony — notices what most people wouldn’t.\\n\\n“He can see loose strings on buttons, something as much as a fingerprint on a not-wiped-down piece of brass,” Selga says.\\n\\nToday, the only adjustment a Sergeant of the Guard makes during the inspection at the Tomb is to pluck something invisible to the crowd off a Sentinel’s jacket.\\n\\nIt’s the final push of tour buses and school groups. Some visitors carry shopping bags from the Air and Space Museum and White House Gifts. Among the later groups are people with reddened eyes dressed in black, who have come to Arlington for more personal reasons. They don’t talk much, even to one another.\\n\\nThough the sun has finally come out, the Sentinels seem impervious to the weather while guarding.\\n\\n“If it’s a hot day, you might come down [to Tomb Quarters] and go, ‘Oof, it’s hot out there,’ ” Selga says. “Or take a deep breath or something that you’re not allowed to do out there.”\\n\\nThough there are some allowances for the weather — in the summer the Sentinels switch every half hour instead of every hour, and they have cold-weather gear for the winter — there aren’t many. All the Sentinels wear the same uniform on the same day, and the Sergeant of the Guard makes that call. If a Sentinel feels it’s too cold for the summer uniform, “he can just suck it up,” Selga says.\\n\\nAt the final change, there are no school groups, just tourists who hurried to make it on time. Every other time, the Sentinels who changed duties gave and acknowledged orders in that peculiar military bark; this time it’s a silent change. Retreat, played at nearby Fort Myer, floats through the air.\\n\\nThere’s no wreath-laying, no taps this time. Blackmore informs the small crowd that Arlington Cemetery is now a restricted military post.\\n\\nEveryone has to leave, except the eight men who have 12 hours left in their workday. Someone will walk the Tomb until 6 p.m.; then, the Sentinels use the space in front for training. Even when that’s done, someone will stand guard, honoring three strangers through the night.\\n\\nIt’s four crypts, one for each war from World War I to Vietnam. Three of them each contain the remains of an unidentified service member. The sarcophagus (the big boxy thing) sits atop the World War I crypt. The other three lie in front of it. The Vietnam crypt is vacant: After exhumation in 1998, the body of Air Force 1st Lt. Michael Blassie was identified using DNA testing. There are no plans to inter another unknown, and the crypt cover now reads “Honoring and Keeping Faith with America’s Missing Servicemen, 1958-1975.”\\n\\nA prior version of this post stated that Specialist Andrew Selga would become a full Sentinel on Oct. 17. That is incorrect; he was already a full Sentinel. On Oct. 17, he got his badge.',\n",

If you do not have a list of chores to do, make an effort to do things around the house. Spend time doing things your family would normally do for you, or make an effort to get things done before anyone asks you to do them.  Focus on the chores you are known for not enjoying. Doing chores that you don't particularly enjoy shows your understanding that sometimes people have to do things that they don't like. If your parents are often asking you to clean your room, keep it as clean as you can all the time. Make sure to do your housework without complaining. Doing your chores without whining about having to do them shows that you understand why they must be done, and demonstrates your maturity. If you hate mowing the lawn or raking leaves, but your parents ask you to do this often, make an effort to take care of the lawn without being asked.  Do chores that benefit everyone living in your house. Spend time doing the dishes for the entire family. If you have a dishwasher and see that it is full of clean dishes, take the time to put them all away. Vacuum or tidy common areas, such as your living room, whenever you notice they need cleaning. Treat school as you would treat a job that you are paid to do. Focus on your school work and set goals for your academic future. Whether your goals revolve around what college you will attend or improving your current grades, spend time planning on how to achieve these goals. Dedicating time to your studies is an important step in showing your maturity.  Be awake and ready for school as early as possible, so your parents do not have to rush you out the door. Finish school related tasks before your parents have to ask you to finish them. Complete your homework as early as possible, and if you can, try to get started on work that may not need to be completed until the following week. Make your parents proud by setting goals that help you earn good grades. If you are struggling in a class, make the effort to reach out for help with that subject, either from your teacher, a tutor, or a classmate. Ask your parents if you can do work around the house to earn money, or take a step further and try to do jobs around the neighborhood. Whether you are walking dogs, mowing lawns, or babysitting, demonstrate to your parents that working for your own money is important to you. This will show them that you are ready to take on more responsibility.  Ask your family for jobs that you can do around the house that are more involved than your regular chores, such as cleaning out the garage. Explain to your family that you are trying to earn your own money and assign rates for each of the jobs they propose. If you are old enough, head out into your neighborhood and offer your services to your neighbors. You can rake leaves or shovel snow, so long as your neighbors have agreed to let you do the job. When you get some cash, whether it's your birthday, a holiday, or money you have earned through hard work, show your parents that you can manage that money responsibly. Avoid spending money that you've received or earned right away, as this can be a sign of impulsivity and immaturity. Your family will respect your decision to responsibly save money.  Ask your parents to help you open up a savings account at your local bank. Set aside a portion of your money for savings and a separate portion for spending on whatever you'd like. This shows that while you might want to spend your hard earned money frivolously, you know that saving money is an important skill to have for the future.\",\n",

              " \"By. Ray Massey. The Third World conditions experienced by passengers at Gatwick airport last Christmas were foreseeable and should be a ‘wake-up call’ to other airports, a report warns today. The report paints a shocking picture of the chaos at Gatwick - with just one functioning but ‘disgusting’ toilet shared by thousands and a lack of food and water for stranded passengers. More than 11,000 travellers were hit by delays and 72 flight cancellations - with easyJet worst affected - on December 24 after flooding caused a power failure at the West Sussex airport. The Third World conditions experienced by passengers at Gatwick airport last Christmas were foreseeable and should be a 'wake-up call' to other airports, a report warns today. The report paints a shocking picture of the chaos at Gatwick - with just one functioning but 'disgusting' In a scathing report, the watchdog said airport bosses needed to ¿get a grip¿ to ensure more passengers are never again failed by poor and inadequate contingency planning. The failure also knocked out flight-information, baggage check-in and retrieval system - which meant that even those who wanted to leave could not get their bags back in order to do so. In a scathing report, the watchdog said airport bosses needed to ‘get a grip’ to ensure more passengers are never again failed by poor and inadequate contingency planning. The flooding fiasco should be ‘a wake-up call for airports across the UK’ in tackling foreseeable disruption’, the MPs said. More effort should also be made to ensure passengers know and receive reimbursement and compensation in line with their consumer rights. More effort should also be made to ensure passengers know and receive reimbursement and compensation in line with their consumer rights. More than 11,000 travellers were hit by delays and 72 flight cancellations - with easyJet worst affected - on December 24. A Gatwick spokesman apologised at the time to passengers saying anti-flood work was in hand but the weather conditions had been extreme. Passengers gave evidence to MPs of the shocking conditions in which they were left for up to 12 hours without heating, hot food or drink and with access to just one functioning but ‘putrid’ toilet. One said: ‘Many toilets, which were reliant on electronic flushing mechanisms, were out of action,’Sussex police had to step in to keep order amid the chaos and lack of loudspeaker announcements. British Airways passengers Neil and Jennifer Smith are quoted by MPs in the report saying: ‘As a result of BA staff’s unwavering refusal to speak to customers or provide any information in the terminal, we received no food or drink vouchers at any stage during our 11 hours at Gatwick.’ Had BA informed them that their luggage was unlikely to be on the plane, ‘we would have bought some essentials from the airport to relieve the stress and discomfort,’ they said. Dr Sylvia Baron said: ‘All this time no food was provided at any point by easyJet (13 hours total).’ Daniel Salt says: ‘eastJet failed at every stage to notify the public of what was happening.’ And Malina Majithia said they received no food or water: ‘More shockingly, the washroom facilities were appalling. The toilets were a disgrace. They did not flush and the putrid stench was overpowering.’ Even Labour peer Lord Triesman, caught up in the chaos spoke of ‘distressed and crying and shouting children’ and the ‘massive queue to the only functioning loo.’ Passengers wait in the departure hall of Gatwick airport's North Terminal as severe weather caused delays and cancellations to numerous flights. Passengers were left for up to 12 hours without heating, hot food or drink and just one toilet to access. Janet Coombs tells MPs: ‘19 hours without food or fluid; 15 hours standing; 15 hours without access to toilets; 2 days lost holiday; 2 nights lost sleep.’ Many phoned relatives outside the airport to find out from news reports what was happening. Anna Powell spoke of lost luggage, distress, and the ‘joy of securing the last chicken’ in Sainsburys but noted: ‘As far as we were concerned our Christmas was cancelled.’ Today the House of Commons Transport Committee thanked those passengers who wrote with their testimony. They said the main problems had been poor and often inconsistent provision of information about what was happening, lack of clarity about who was in charge, and a lack of basic facilities, such as toilets and drinking water. Christmas plans were badly affected for thousands of people after storms across the UK resulted in flooding and caused havoc at Gatwick Airport. Passengers gave evidence to MPs of the shocking conditions in which they were left for up to 12 hours without heating. The committee welcomed a key conclusion from Gatwick¿s own review of the events on Christmas Eve which found the airport should appoint passenger champions at each of its terminals. The chaos at Gatwick was compounded when airport bosses sought to switch passengers from the blighted North Terminal to the still-working South Terminal in a move that ‘was not well tested.’ MPs were particularly concerned the ‘that contingency planning had not involved major airlines.’ Launching the report today, the committee’s chairman Louise Ellman, Labour MP for Liverpool Riverside said: ‘Passengers need accurate and consistent information, must be able to identify who is in charge during periods of disruption, and should have ready access to toilets and drinking water. ‘If our largest airports cannot demonstrate they can look after passengers’ interests in this way then the CAA must act.’ She added: ‘Passengers must also be promptly reimbursed for the extra costs they face as a consequence of disruption.' Mrs Ellman said: ‘It was clear from evidence to this inquiry that there is considerable scope for airlines to ensure passengers are far better informed about their rights when flights are delayed or cancelled and how to enforce these rights.’ Passengers need accurate and consistent information, Labour MP Louise Ellman said. The flood caused a power failure which severely disrupted flights at the airport¿s North Terminal. The committee welcomed a key conclusion from Gatwick’s own review of the events on Christmas Eve which found the airport should appoint passenger champions at each of its terminals, to focus on passenger welfare. The committee suggested that similar arrangements should also be put in place at other major UK airports. Gatwick’s own report into the chaos concluded in February that passengers were failed because airport bosses ‘overreached themselves’ and communications to passengers were ‘disappointingly poor’. The flood caused a power failure which severely disrupted flights at the airport’s North Terminal. But rather than cancel flights straight away managers tried to get as many people away as possible - by switching them to the unaffected South Terminal. However, this merely added to the chaos. Gatwick non-executive director David McMillan said in own February report: ‘On this occasion, the airport community overreached itself in seeking to maintain a close-to-normal flying programme on the day. MPs demanded to know why the country¿s second-biggest airport had been unable to cope with flooding. ‘In doing so, while the majority of airport passengers flew that day, a very significant number of passengers endured poor levels of service and information before seeing their flights either substantially delayed or, ultimately, cancelled.’ MPs had earlier accused country’s second-biggest airport -owned by an American private equity Global Infrastructure Partners of failing to invest at Gatwick while making bumper profits. Transport committee chairman Louise Ellman said the sorts of problems encountered by Gatwick should not have been unforeseen, unexpected or unprepared for: ‘The problems that unfolded were not new and the whole event should be a wake-up call for airports across the UK to improve their operational resilience.’ This was the scene at Gatwick Airport Station on Christmas Eve amid chaos around the airport. The report itself concludes: ‘None of the issues discussed in our report is new. Contingency planning, communications and passenger welfare were all covered in the Begg report into disruption at Heathrow due to snow in December 2011., themes we then picked up in our 2011 report on the disruption to transport caused by snow and ice.’ It added: ‘The CAA recently told us that it had already given the industry some guidance about what is expected in relation to oversight of operational resilience.’ MPs said the CAA had told them: ‘If the plans produced by airports over the Spring and Summer do not include all appropriate elements, we will use our licence powers to requite this to be remedied.’\",\n",

Timothy, 60, was standing up riding on the back of a golf cart while his wife, 55, drove them and another couple to the club house to get food.

              " 'The beheading of American aid worker Peter Kassig by ISIS is an act of cruelty, but it\\'s also an act of desperation by a terrorist organization that has found itself on the run. None of us, sadly, can be surprised anymore at the brutality of ISIS, the insidious group that now controls huge chunks of territory in Syria and Iraq. But Kassig\\'s murder also reveals how little regard the so-called \"Islamic State\" has for Islamic values. Moderate and radical Islamic clerics alike had called for ISIS to spare the life of Kassig -- also known as Abdul-Rahman -- a former U.S. Army Ranger who toured Iraq in 2007 and converted to Islam during his year in captivity. Killing a convert to Islam is an extremely serious violation of the well-established consensus in the Islamic community on the sacredness of life for converts to the religion. Abu Muhammed al-Maqdsi, a mentor to many al Qaeda leaders, had called for mercy -- not only because Kassig was a convert to Islam, but because he had given up so much to move to Syria and help victims of the war. Militant Islamists in the country also went public with a request for mercy. They said Kassig, a trained medic, had treated them when they were injured in battles against Syrian government forces. It was inevitable that these calls would fall on deaf ears. Beheading Western hostages is one of the only tools ISIS has at its disposal to retaliate against the American-led airstrikes that are beginning to land serious blows on the group. Hundreds of fighters have been killed by airstrikes in Iraq and Syria, particularly around the Syrian town of Kobani, and Iraqi troops have also made a series of advances. It took the Americans about two months to build up a critical mass of intelligence -- what U.S. military officials call \"patterns of life\" -- about the behaviors and organization of ISIS, but in the last few weeks that critical work has begun to bear fruit. On November 7, American warplanes bombed a convoy of vehicles near Mosul, in northern Iraq. The airstrikes were conducted against what was assessed to be a meeting of ISIS leaders near the town. Unconfirmed reports suggested that a number of top commanders -- including ISIS chief Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi -- could have been injured in the attack. While it is difficult to keep track of the latest developments on the ground, what we do know is this: The momentum, at least in Iraq, is shifting. The group\\'s leaders are being hunted down, and they\\'re feeling the pain. In July, a video emerged of a defiant Baghdadi delivering a sermon at a mosque in Mosul. Last week, ISIS released an audio clip of a man purporting to be Baghdadi -- a sign that, like al Qaeda\\'s leaders before them, ISIS bosses are going deeper and deeper underground. ISIS\\' surge has been blunted by U.S. airstrikes. The days when the group could sweep into a town and take it over seem long gone. The Iraqi army along with its allies -- the Kurds and the Shia militias -- have made good progress in the past two months, retaking Baiji and other strategic towns in Iraq. The nation\\'s military is being restructured and rebuilt, and the Iraqi state is beginning to stand on its own two feet. The terror group\\'s success up until now has been based on its ability to sell its narrative to poor local Sunni communities. ISIS has portrayed itself as the defender of persecuted Sunnis against sectarian Shia-led governments in Iraq and Syria and elsewhere, and embedded itself into the communities of cities like Mosul, Tikrit and Fallujah. This narrative brought thousands of Sunnis together to fight the Shia under ISIS\\' banner, even though these tribes didn\\'t subscribe to the group\\'s extremist ideology. But more and more Sunnis are beginning to realize that ISIS isn\\'t their friend. In fact Muslims, have until now borne the brunt of ISIS\\' brutality. The group has killed thousands of Shias and Sunnis are also being targeted. In August, ISIS fighters massacred 700 members of the Sunni Shaitat tribe in eastern Syria, according to the Washington Post. In early November, ISIS murdered hundreds of members of the Albu Nimr tribe, a powerful Sunni clan in Anbar province, west of Baghdad. Today, more and more Sunni tribes are beginning to organize themselves in opposition to ISIS\\' bloody reign. The battle for Kobani could now prove to be the turning point. ISIS has made a last stand of sorts in this small Kurdish town on Syria\\'s border with Turkey. The group wanted to send a message to the world that not only could it defeat local opposition, it could defeat the Americans. That mission has failed, and it was a monstrous strategic error. ISIS poured thousands of skilled fighters into Kobani. We have evidence that many of them never returned, and that ISIS has forced local policemen to join their ranks. But the heroic will of the Kurdish defense forces in Kobani have broken the group\\'s will -- and most significantly, they have shattered ISIS\\' narrative of invincibility. Kobani has shown that ISIS can be defeated. ISIS has been stopped in its tracks. The group is bleeding and the beheading of Kassig shows ISIS\\' desperation to lash out, to show that it still has options. Is the battle over? Of course not. It will be long, it will be costly, it will be risky, and it will last for years -- perhaps even a decade. This is an army of tens of thousands of skilled, fanatical soldiers who are willing to kill and be killed. The voice (purported to be Baghdadi\\'s) on last week\\'s recording declared: \"They will never abandon fighting ... They will be triumphant even if only one man of them is left.\" The top-down approach of airstrikes and ground forces won\\'t rid the Middle East of ISIS\\' insidious ideology. This is not about winning one or two battles -- it\\'s about dismantling Baghdadi\\'s killing machine from the ground up. The group can only be defeated when its sectarian narrative about the persecution of Sunnis is dismantled. We need a bottom-up approach that addresses the legitimate grievances of poor Sunni communities in Iraq and Syria, and gives them a stake in their political future. We need a political solution to the civil war in Syria that has provided ISIS with motivation, funding, and thousands of skilled soldiers. And we need to put an end to the proxy war being waged in these countries by the Sunni rulers of Saudi Arabia and the Shia regime in Iran. Given the complexity of the situation, this is all easier said than done. The latest developments have shown that ISIS is not invincible -- but to defeat the group, military cooperation without true political consensus on how to end the crisis will not be enough.',\n",

Victor White III died in March while restrained in the back of a deputy's car at the sheriff's station in New Iberia, Louisiana. Louisiana State Police initially reported that Mr White shot himself in the back when his hands were cuffed behind him. But this contradicts the final report of the Iberia Parish coroner, released six months later, which states that Mr White was shot in the chest, not the back. He and a friend, Isaiah Lewis, 24, were searched by police at around 11.30pm on March 2. After officers found cocaine and marijuana, Mr White was transported to the patrol centre to be questioned by narcotics detectives. He died of a gun shot wound after a bullet entered his right chest, perforated his left lung and heart and then exited under his left armpit, the coroner's report states. Mr White was left-handed, according to family members. A forensic pathologists found gunshot residue in the wound and cuts were seen on Mr White's face. Dr Carl Ditch ruled that White shot himself, and declared his death a suicide on Monday. In a statement, he said: 'Although the decedent was handcuffed at the time with his hands to his back, due to his body habitus (type), the pathologist and investigators agree that he would have been able to manipulate the weapon to the point where the contact wound was found.' Dr. Maranda Kles, a forensic expert with UL Lafayette reviewed the autopsy and coroner's statement. Louisiana State Police initially reported that Mr White shot himself in the back, but a coroner's report states he was shot in the chest and declared that it was a suicide. She explained the bullet entered on the right lateral or side part of the chest and exited on the left. When asked, how it might have been possible for White to manoeuvre and retrieve the gun, she said: 'If there was some give in those handcuffs that allowed for movement in the arms over to the side, movement of the hands it could have been possible. 'The further the gun is away from the body, the larger the spread of that pattern. If you have no stippling, it typically means you have a very close or contact wound which means the gun was pressed against the skin or in very, very close proximity, millimeters from the skin.' Mr White's father, a Baptist minister and former substance abuse counselor, has expressed anger at the verdict, which he believes is physically impossible. Dr Carl Ditch ruled that White shot himself and said: 'Although the decedent was handcuffed at the time, the pathologist and investigators agree that he would have been able to manipulate the weapon' Reverend Victor White II, 53, said: 'You can't make me understand how my son took his left hand, when he was handcuffed behind the back, and shot himself. I don't believe a thing they're saying at this point.' His son had begun saving for an apartment with his long-time girlfriend and their infant daughter before he died on either March 2 or March 3. Family members say he had no history of depression and was trying to decide whether to go to community college or apply for a more job  on one of the  Gulf of Mexico oil rigs. A justice for Victor defence fund started by his parents has raised $3,700.\",\n",

              " 'Before you feed your frog, you should feed its prey. Crickets are the primary food source for captive red-eyed tree frogs. One or two days before you feed your frog, feed the crickets a mix of dried and fresh foods to ensure that they are full of essential nutrients. Some good foods for crickets include crushed dog or cat food pellets, commercially produced cricket feed, mixed seeds, alfalfa, lettuce,  broccoli, carrots, and fruit.  For adult frogs, dust their prey with reptile calcium/vitamin D3 supplements once a week. For younger frogs, you may have to do this every day. This will ensure that your frog is receiving all of its proper nutrients.  The crickets you feed your frog should be no larger than their head. For young frogs, make sure that they are no bigger than a quarter of an inch long. Red-eyed tree frogs are insectivores, which means that they eat bugs and insects such as grasshoppers, crickets, and moths. You can buy live crickets from a pet or reptile store. Feed your frog around fifteen live crickets every two to three days. Red-eyed tree frogs will occasionally eat worms as well. Wax worms are recommended for this. Do not feed them meal worms. Not all frogs will accept worms to eat, however. A wide, shallow water dish will allow your frogs to drink and hydrate. A water dish is essential because it will allow the frog to cool down if they are too hot or wash down if they become too dry. It can even increase the humidity in the terrarium. A heavy plastic or clay water dish will prevent spills.  Water should be changed every day.  If you have many frogs in one cage, you might want to have multiple water bowls. Red-eyed tree frogs need a humidity of around 90%. To help maintain the humidity, spray the terrarium with a water-filled spray bottle twice a day. Spray the walls, substrate, and furnishings.  If your frog’s skin is looking dry, you can even spray them. Be careful not to spray them in their face. You can also invest in an automatic misting system. These are expensive, but they will handle the spraying process to ensure that your frogs are properly hydrated.',\n",

The couple revealed on Monday that North\\'s baby brother will be called Saint, which the Guardian reports is a little more common than North: There were 32 Saints born in 2014, according to Social Security Administration records, while FiveThirtyEight points out there were only 13 Norths.

              " \"The Duchess of Cambridge's brother has failed to make a profit with his food business for the third year in a row, after recording an annual £23,000 loss. James Middleton's cake and bread brand Nice Group London Limited made a total loss of £23,353 for the 12 months to March 2014, accounts filed this week have shown. It means the company, which was set up in April 2011, is yet to post a profit, having lost £19,928 in its first year of trading and £21,148 in its second year. The company also owes creditors £76,394. The cake and bread business run by James Middleton, 27 (left), the brother of the Duchess of Cambridge (right), has lost more than £23,000 in its third year. A visit to the company's website today shows it is still under construction. Mr Middleton, 27, has again had to ask his family for financial help for the business, according to the accounts filed at Companies House. Under a section entitled Creditors: Amounts falling due within one year, it reads: 'The bank overdraft is secured by a member of the director's family.' He told MailOnline: 'My focus over the last year has been on Boomf as it really has taken off. 'We managed to secure £1million in funding and are up 320 per cent from last Christmas, we are shipping all over the world and we are also in Selfridges printing onto marshmallows there and then. 'We have our first TV advert coming out next month, which is very exciting and we are launching new products this year so my energy has been focused on Boomf.' He added: 'This will be a deciding year for Nice Group.' Mr Middleton, a former public school boy, dropped out of the University of Edinburgh in 2006 after a year of studying to go into business. He set up Nice Group London in 2011, the same year sister Kate married Prince William. But he has so far failed to recreate the success of his parents, Carol and Michael, who made millions with their own Party Pieces venture. Mr Middleton has defended his losses in previous years, telling MailOnline: 'Nice Group is a start-up company and as you can imagine there are overheads needed to start a company. The former public school boy has had to ask his family for financial help. He is pictured with his other sister Pippa (left) who has her own budding career in journalism. 'It is not uncommon for start-up companies to make a loss in the early stages of development and it is not something I am concerned about right now.' Nice Group London is registered to the family's trading headquarters close to their Berkshire home. It filed the accounts signed by Mr Middleton - the sole director and shareholder - with Companies House. The paperwork covers the company's third full year of trading. Mr Middleton is also a director at Nice Cakes,\\xa0which sells things such as personalised cupcakes which have company logos and photographs printed in edible ink. It caused controversy in its early days by selling a line of adult-themed cakes iced with naughty slogans. These included a 'stud muffin' cake featuring a picture of a man and the caption: 'A willy that wriggles and gives me the giggles'. Another is the Cake Kit Company, which sells bits needed to make different styles of birthday cakes, including a princess-like doll. Hopefully the budding entrepreneur will have better luck with the bespoke marshmallow company he founded, Boomf - which sells nine marshmallows for $25 (£15).\",\n",

              " 'Keep the planner in your school bag. Then, whenever you get homework, write it down right away in your planner so you don’t forget about it. Keeping track of what homework you have and when it’s due will help you stay organized and prevent you from missing important assignments that can impact your grades.  Everyone forgets about assignments sometimes. It happens! Having a planner is a good backup in case you do forget. If you do end up missing homework for some reason, talk to your teacher about it. Tell them you know you messed up, and ask if you can turn it in late. You might not get full credit, but they still might give you some points, which is better than not turning anything in at all. It might be the last thing you want to do after a long day at school, but that way you won’t forget about it or procrastinate too long. Plus, if you have any questions or get confused by something, you’ll have more time to ask for help and figure out a solution. If you do your homework right after school, you’ll have the whole rest of the evening to just relax. On the other hand, if you keep putting it off until later at night, it will just be weighing on your mind all evening. If you have a major project, paper, or other assignment that’s coming up, schedule plenty of time to work on it so you don’t end up scrambling to finish at the last minute. You can even start earlier than you need to and just get it over with so it’s one less thing on your plate. Write the due date for the assignment in your planner, and then write reminders on the days in between now and then so you don’t forget about it. For example, if you have a research paper due in 6 weeks, don’t wait until the last week before it’s due to get started. Instead, start brainstorming and researching right away. The more time you give yourself, the less stressed you’ll feel and the better work you’ll produce. Turning in incomplete or wrong homework can negatively affect your grade, and it can put you behind for the following day’s class. Instead of risking it, ask your parents or a friend in your class for some advice if you feel stuck. You can also meet with your teacher before class if you have time and let them know that you’re struggling. That way, you’ll clear up any confusion, get a better grade on your assignment, and be more prepared for the classroom discussion and future test.',\n",

              " '\"Jag är nyfiken \\x96 Yellow\" is a lot of fun. Like at least one other reviewer, I was, on numerous occasions, laughing out loud. Yellow is energetic, playful, self-aware, explorative. Don\\'t expect Bergman here. This movie is about a youth in the early- to mid-60s in Sweden and about the issues, read *contradictions*, that the nation and the world were facing. At times Yellow appears to be an earnest social-political documentary, with Lena, the main character, and others interviewing both common people and politicians (e.g. Olaf Palme at home). At other times, Yellow seems to parody this kind of documentary. All the while, Yellow acts as a personal documentary exploring Lena\\'s life - her home life, her loves, her political views, her view of herself. She is a complete person \\x96 complex, flawed, contradictory, happy, sad, curious. And placed over all of this is the wonderful additional dimension of the director, Sjöman, and his crew documenting themselves documenting Lena. It is this that, for me, really gives Yellow wings. Not only do they suddenly appear at some very funny times and in some funny ways, reminding the viewer that this is fiction and artifice, but their presence is itself another layer of the film; they are filming themselves filming themselves. I am reminded of a Bjork music video with this same quality \\x96 a music video about the making of a music video, ad infinitum, with each iteration getting weirder and more cartoonish. I think Sjöman may have had something similar in mind.

              " \"There is a predictable pattern that ensues following any tragic news in Nigeria. There is at first a collective sense of shock and grief. There follows official visits to the scene of the tragedy. Families are condoled and money is doled out in compensation. A period of mourning is inevitably announced. In a country where nothing happens quickly, committees and investigative panels will then be set up with remarkable alacrity. Months will pass. And then nothing. The result is always the same. Rhetoric, followed by vacuous proclamations but ultimately, inaction. The banal sequence has already begun playing out with news of Sunday's fatal air crash in Lagos which claimed over 150 lives. This time, however, Nigerians are demanding answers. Accidents do happen of course but the memories of January's mass protests are fresh and there lingers a suspicion of government negligence. It is far too early to determine the outcome of the crash but early indications are that this was an entirely avoidable disaster. See also: Nigerians no longer 'suffering and smiling' The investigation must begin with Dana Air, operators of the ill fated Boeing MD-83. The irony is that the Indian-owned airline has quite a decent track record since they began operations in Nigeria four years ago. With a modest number of four aircraft in its fleet, the airline had grown at a reasonable pace and had just taken delivery of another Boeing MD-83 in May. A strong focus on domestic services and competitive fares had seen Dana Air become the airline of choice for many regular fliers. There were signs, however, in the last six months that standards had begun to slip. First came the irregular take-off times. Dana flights, once paragons of punctuality, started taking off late or sometimes not at all. The delays were quite often without reason. On 15 May this year, I waited with other passengers for over six hours to board as engineers addressed a mechanical problem on one of its planes. On a separate occasion, we were to board the last Dana Flight out of Lagos to Abuja. The flight was canceled and no explanation given. There was no offer of compensation either. Dana Air has also faced accusations of penny-pinching. Even before Sunday's crash, there had been suggestions that Dana's four aircraft were being overworked. See also: iReport images from Lagos. On Sunday alone, the aircraft with registration number 5N-RAM was already on its fourth trip of the day and scheduled to make another one. In May, the same aircraft had to make two unscheduled air returns following reports of engine failure, according to a Dana Air station manager in Lagos. Whatever the outcome of the investigation, the omens are not good for Dana Air. No Nigerian airline has ever fully recovered from an air disaster. EAS Airlines, Bellview, SoSoLiso and ADC Air were all Nigerian airlines with decent sized fleets and considerable goodwill just ten years ago. Their names all became obsolete pretty quickly following a spate of crashes between 2002 and 2006. The government has taken the step of withdrawing their operational license and ground Dana aircraft whilst an inquiry takes place. Even in the event of continued operations, there would have been a likely slump in passenger bookings which will harm the airline. The investigation must go beyond Dana and extend to the Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA). The main regulator of the country's airline industry will need to face some tough questions as well. Did they do enough to minimize the chance of such a crash? The Dana Air was 22 years old, which is not exactly ancient in aviation terms but given that Nigerian law prohibits aircraft over the age of 20 from operating, who fell asleep at the switch? Besides at that age, any aircraft would require maintenance checks to be as regular as they are vigorous. Separate eyewitness accounts of leaking hydraulics on the MD-83 do not suggest that this was the case. This time around the Nigerian public is in no mood for obfuscation or cover-ups. The last major air incident in Nigeria was in October 2006 when an ADC airlines flight crashed near Abuja and killed 96 on board. The outcome of the subsequent investigation was never revealed but now there is a growing demand that such information is shared with the public. Following that crash, the government grounded all commercial aircraft and revoked the licenses of many. Air worthiness became a paramount issue and as a result the slack operators were forced to tighten up. Those that could not shape up exited the scene. On that occasion it took over 500 deaths in five years to shake the government into action. If laxity has started to creep back into Nigeria's aviation sector, one hopes that it will not take a similar rash of incidents to ensure that safety standards are being consistently met.

              " '– If James K. Polk doesn\\'t already hold the record for most burials of a former US president, there\\'s little doubt he soon will. The Tennessee Senate voted 20-6 Monday to allow the remains of the 11th president to be exhumed and reburied—for the third time, the AP reports. Unsurprisingly, the repeated digging up of a president hasn\\'t been without controversy. According to the Washington Post, Polk died of cholera in 1849 and was quickly buried in a mass grave in Nashville City Cemetery. Laws at the time required people who died of infectious diseases to be buried within 24 hours. A year later, his body was reburied at his home in Nashville as specified in his will, the Tennessean reports. Polk\\'s remains were moved again in 1891 after a family fight resulted in his home being sold and eventually becoming a hotel. The idea to move Polk\\'s remains a third time—from the grounds of the state Capitol to his family\\'s home in Columbia—comes from Tom Price, the curator of the James K. Polk Home and Museum. He says the move will help better preserve Polk\\'s legacy and improve awareness of the former president—and maybe even increase visits to the museum, which lag far behind those to Andrew Jackson\\'s nearby home. But some of Polk\\'s descendants are against the move, calling it \"degrading\" and akin to \"grave robbery.\" The resolution to exhume and relocate Polk\\'s remains still needs to be approved by a court, the state\\'s House of Representatives, and the Tennessee Historical Society.',\n",

The report concludes that the proposed pipeline from Canada to Texas would not affect global greenhouse gas emissions in a significant way, reports the Washington Post. This doesn\\'t mean the project is now a slam-dunk, but the environmental assessment was seen as one of its biggest remaining hurdles. President Obama has said that he would sign off on the pipeline only if it didn\\'t \"significantly exacerbate\" carbon pollution, and the report seems to satisfy that requirement. So what\\'s next? John Kerry and his State Department now must consider other factors beyond the environment—the economic impact, relations with Canada, etc.—in making a final decision. As one State official tells the Post: The report \"does not answer the broader question about how a decision on this potential pipeline fits in with broader national and international efforts to address climate change and climate priorities or other questions of foreign policy or energy security.\" Eight separate agencies have three months to weigh in, reports the Wall Street Journal.',\n",

This delicious term has been coined by a tour operator that is packaging two-destination holidays with great shopping cities at their core. Many itineraries put hundreds of miles between the closest shopping mecca and the beach, but Western & Oriental's Rome-Amalfi combination is one of many possible pairings in which a world-class shopping capital and a legendary vacation playground are linked by just a few hours' drive. Rome and Amalfi Coast, Italy. Western & Oriental suggests a shop-over in Rome before chilling out on the romantic and glorious Amalfi Coast. And the Eternal City is not all about Gucci, Prada and other Italian designer stores lining the Via Condotti; Western & Oriental puts up its guests in Monti, a hip neighborhood with some great little boutiques, happening bars and cool restaurants. In Amalfi, it's back to tradition at the Monastero Santa Rosa, converted from a 17th-century monastery. Like all the most desirable hotels along this coast, it offers fabulous mountainside views over the sea. From $2,635, excluding international airfare, for the four-star Rome and Amalfi combo: www.wandotravel.com. New York and Vermont, United States. No one disputes that the Big Apple is the shopping capital of the world, but it's less well-known that certain hotels have close links with the personal shoppers in Manhattan's most desirable stores. The Waldorf Towers concierge can arrange for personal shoppers from Barneys or Bloomingdale's to come to the hotel, or you can have your in-store purchases delivered to the hotel at any hour, leaving you unburdened as you head downtown to shop the boutiques of SoHo and other areas. Not to mention that the Towers apartments have the heady 1930s ambiance of a Fred and Ginger movie. From Shop-Till-You-Drop Central, peaceful Vermont is only a four-hour drive. The Blue Horse Inn in Woodstock is a serene place to stay in a beautiful village -- and there is more retail therapy not far away at the tony outlet town of Manchester, Vermont. Mumbai and Goa, India. You can fly direct to Goa's beaches on the west coast of India, perhaps the most laid-back and eclectic coastal paradise in the world. But it's more fun to take a couple of days to explore the country's most cosmopolitan and vibrant city, Mumbai -- not least because it's home to so much great homegrown design. The best way to explore the boutiques is to hire a car and driver for half a day and hand over a list of hot addresses. These should include Anokhi, Abraham & Thakore and Le Mill, but at a top hotel like the Taj Mahal Palace, the concierge will know the names of even newer, hotter places shoppers may want to add. The hotel has one of the world's best urban outdoor pools, perfect for post-shop chilling in a hectic town. Paris and Normandy, France. Paris is such a brilliant shopping city, you'll be footsore by the time you've combed the Rue des Francs Bourgeois and other shopping streets of the trendy Marais, not to mention the Rue Napoleon on the Left Bank and the designer haunts of the Faubourg St. Honore. A hotel designed specifically for ladies who shop is the Sofitel Paris Le Faubourg, with fashion murals in the corridors and in-room macaroons on request. Kitted out in style, head for the Gare St. Lazare station and follow the chic Parisiens taking the train to the twin resorts of Deauville and Trouville on the Normandy coast. They're as different as chalk and cheese; Deauville, with its upscale boutiques and boardwalk emblazoned with the names of Hollywood stars, looks like a location for a Ralph Lauren resort catalog. Trouville is laid-back, charming and family-friendly; don't miss the fabulous brasserie Les Vapeurs for a dinner that could turn into a wild night. You can walk from one town to the other.

Many international designer brands are housed in Maison Mode on Huaihai Road, but it's more fun to hunt down local designers like Mary Ching, whose shoes are China's Louboutins, on Ferguson Lane. Fashionistas can now stay within a few steps of the boutiques in The Langham hotel in Xintiandi. Less than two hours' drive away, the old China lives on in Zhou Zhuang water village, dubbed the Venice of the Orient for its canals. The highlight is a picturesque double bridge, with Chinese gondoliers standing by to ply the waterways.

A non-cookie-cutter choice with one of the most famous Suzhou gardens on its doorstep, as well as greenery of its own, is the Garden Hotel. Marrakech and Essaouira, Morocco. The souks of Marrakech are a shopper's paradise for everything from embroidered kaftans to punched-metal lanterns to the pointy-toed slippers known as babouches.

Choose one of the riads -- lovely old houses built around courtyards -- within the medina, or old city, just a five-minute stroll from the souks. Riad Farnatchi offers good insider info and has a great hammam for soothing sore feet with steam and massage. On the next leg, drive to Essaouira, a dazzling little blue and white town on Morocco's west coast with a medina of its own that's light, bright and laid-back, a complete contrast to crowded Marrakech. Essaouira's original guesthouse, the Villa Maroc, offers traditional decor, bags of atmosphere, a popular restaurant and the odd celebrity sighting. Melbourne and Daylesford, Australia. From high design to vintage fashion, resin jewelry to aboriginal art, Melbourne is Australia's shopping mecca, thanks to a diverse and creative population. It's more about the neighborhoods than downtown; check out tony South Yarra (Chapel Street), edgy Fitzroy (Gertrude Street and Brunswick Street) and eclectic Prahran (Greville Street and the fabulous Prahran Market). You can stay among some of the best boutiques at the Olsen Hotel on Chapel Street. Within a 90-minute drive is Daylesford, whose mineral springs make it Melbourne's spa bolthole of choice. The village of Daylesford itself is charming, and if you can't linger overnight, there are day spas, including the historic Hepburn Bathhouse in nearby Hepburn Springs. But it would be a shame to miss a stay at charming properties like the Lake House, which boasts an award-winning restaurant as well as a state-of-the-art spa.

              " 'Peter Bogdanovich would like to thank a man he never met. The man\\'s name was James Blakely, and he was a member of the editorial department at 20th Century Fox. He loved musicals and Cole Porter, and was primed to like \"At Long Last Love,\" Bogdanovich\\'s Porter-infused musical. After the 1975 film flopped, Blakely quietly decided to recut it. \"Obviously he took one look at what we\\'d done and said, \\'These guys are screwing up the movie. I\\'m going to fix it.\\' And he was right,\" says Bogdanovich in an interview. \"And he took his time and did it right and saved the movie from the garbage can.\" The film is now out on Blu-ray. Bogdanovich, who\\'s preparing a new film produced by Noah Baumbach and Wes Anderson, took a few minutes to talk to CNN about \"At Long Last Love,\" the value of previews and his thoughts on today\\'s Hollywood. The following is an edited version of the conversation. CNN: Tell me how \"At Long Last Love\" came to be. Peter Bogdanovich: I was reading through (a Cole Porter book) Cybill (Shepherd, his then partner) gave me, and enjoying the lyrics, and thought maybe I should write a musical based on these lyrics. And then I read one of the songs, a very unfamiliar song and not a very famous one, called \"I Loved Him (but He Didn\\'t Love Me).\" It sort of gave me the idea for the whole picture. CNN: Burt Reynolds was unusual casting. Bogdanovich: I didn\\'t have Burt Reynolds in mind. I was thinking of Elliott Gould, who was a song and dance man, and then Sue Mengers became Burt Reynolds\\' agent, and she was my agent, and she said, \"Why don\\'t you use Burt?\" So I met with him and I liked him, and I figured we\\'ll try him, he\\'s a big star, and I thought he would be charming. And he was. Burt could do anything -- he was very talented. He was limited by his action-hero persona. I remember when we made \"Nickelodeon,\" he had a scene with a rifle and the first take was a little macho. I said, \"Can we do it a little less Burt Reynolds?\" He laughed. CNN: When you were making \"At Long Last Love,\" were you worried about the timing was off? The mid-\\'70s was an era full of dark pictures. Bogdanovich: I guess I didn\\'t give a s***. I had purposely made \"What\\'s Up, Doc?\" as a G-rated comedy, and that was in \\'72, and they asked me when we were making it are you sure you don\\'t want to make it a PG? I said no, I want to make it for the whole family -- a G-rated comedy with no socially redeeming value. And they all laughed and left me alone, and that was the biggest success of my career. So I thought a musical with a similar light touch would be welcome, but I didn\\'t realize how difficult it is to find the right balance between singing and talking, which is the key to it. And Jim Blakely found it. Putting Hollywood\\'s biggest bombs back together. CNN: Did the reviews sting? Bogdanovich: I didn\\'t read all the nasty reviews. The thing is, before the picture opened, the critic Judith Crist -- she was a friend -- called me up and said, \"How is the picture?\" I said, \"Pretty good, I think.\" She said, \"It better be good. They\\'re waiting for you with the knives out.\" And she was in the critical establishment -- she knew from which she spoke. We showed them the worst version that existed. (The film) began with Cybill, which was the worst thing to begin with, because they hated her and me particularly. That was the period when you couldn\\'t open a newspaper or magazine without seeing some nasty crack about us. Cary Grant, who was a friend, called me and said, \"Peter, for Chrissakes, stop telling people you\\'re happy, and stop telling them you\\'re in looooove.\" \"Why, Cary?\" \" \\'Cause they\\'re not happy, and they\\'re not in love.\" \"I thought all the world loves a lover?\" \"Naaaa, don\\'t you believe it.\" So that was the climate at that point. The picture was killed, except for people such as Roger Ebert, who liked it to a degree, and the Newsweek critic, who liked it to a degree. Woody Allen told me years later that, \"I saw that picture at the (Radio City) Music Hall three or four times. I really liked it.\" I said, \"S***, Woody, I wish you\\'d told me that then.\" Nobody was more surprised than I was when I saw it streaming on Netflix and I thought, \"This is good.\" You can get too close to a picture. We needed to put it in front of audiences -- it would have taken five or six previews and we would have gotten it right. We only had two previews, which is ridiculous for a musical. CNN: Did you find previews helpful? Bogdanovich: I had very interesting experiences. \"The Last Picture Show\" was at one of those places where the audience was told to turn a knob one way if they like it and another if they don\\'t. And the picture was not liked at all. Columbia turned to me and said, \"What do we do?\" I said, \"I think they need to be told it\\'s a good picture.\" And they snapped their fingers and said, \"Tastemaker screenings.\" So we had 30 screenings for small groups of people and the buzz was extraordinary. We previewed \"What\\'s Up, Doc?\" in Denver and it was a spectacular success. We previewed \"Paper Moon\" in Denver and it played perfectly. We didn\\'t preview \"Daisy Miller.\" And we did preview \"At Long Last Love,\" and you know the results of that. I was told by people I trusted to take things out that really damaged the picture. CNN: What do you think of Hollywood these days? Does the tentpole mentality concern you? Bogdanovich: It\\'s crazy. When Jim Cameron was making \"Titanic,\" everybody was (saying) it\\'s going to be a big flop, Cameron\\'s folly. I said, if that picture\\'s a hit, we\\'re in real trouble. And sure enough, it was a hit. And sure enough (budgets skyrocketed). Spend $150 million! Spend $200 million! And that\\'s where we are today.',\n",

              " \"By. Rebecca Camber. Last updated at 11:46 PM on 4th January 2012. 'Flirting': Elizabeth Filkin warned police to watch out for hacks who might try to get them drunk to reveal information. Police officers have been warned they face the sack if they have ‘improper’ communications with journalists. A review into the relationship between Scotland Yard and the media has called for tighter controls on the release of information. It even recommends that officers should not drink alcohol with journalists because it ‘loosens tongues’. But it is feared that the rules will lead to less information reaching the public as officers are deterred from speaking out. The guidelines could also allow police to bypass questioning and the potentially critical glare of the media by briefing community groups instead. The report, by Dame Elizabeth Filkin, the former parliamentary commissioner for standards, was ordered by former Met Commissioner Sir Paul Stephenson. It followed allegations that ‘cosy relationships involving excessive hospitality between some senior officers and News of the World journalists’ had undermined the Met’s phone hacking inquiry. Sir Paul later resigned following criticism of his decision to hire ex-News of the World executive Neil Wallis as a PR consultant. He had also accepted a £12,000 freebie. at a luxury health spa promoted by Mr Wallis, who was arrested in July. over alleged hacking. Yesterday Met Commissioner Bernard Hogan-Howe said. there would be ‘no more secret conversations’. He issued a stark warning to officers. that whistle-blowers who act ‘improperly’ by leaking stories for. malicious, selfish purposes or who merely pass on gossip would face. disciplinary action. Ms Filkin's report was commissioned by former Met commissioner Sir Paul Stephenson, left, who subsequently resigned amid allegations about the force's PR contract with former News International executive Neil Wallis, right. If leaks did not lead to criminal proceedings,. ‘robust’ management action would be required, he said. Officers could be banned from accepting lucrative work as media pundits soon after leaving Scotland Yard. The report said such moves had damaged the Met. It criticised officers such as Andy Hayman, a former assistant commissioner who was responsible for the original phone hacking inquiry, who became a columnist for The Times two months after leaving the force. The Times is owned by News International, the company at the centre of the phone hacking scandal. Dame Elizabeth said: ‘The speed with which some former police officers take employment within the media is a cause for concern. ‘I am also concerned that former police officers, some of whom have been dismissed, take employment with private investigation firms and continue to obtain information from former colleagues.’ The report said there was a ‘range of. contact that is not permitted’ and which, if unregulated, would continue. to damage trust in the impartiality of the police. Officers are advised to watch out for. reporters’ ‘flirting’ and ‘late-night carousing’, which were described. as ‘long-standing media tactics to get you to spill the beans’. The report also found that contact. between the police and the media had ‘not been transparent enough’. Under the guidelines, officers are to be told to brief community groups. instead of mainstream media. Dame Elizabeth said officers should. ‘weigh up the risk’ when speaking to the Press and formalise meetings by. making a note of every conversation, with those records open to a. random audit. She said: ‘There are lots of other. channels they should be using, because lots of people don’t hear about. what the Met is doing through the Press. ‘They hear about it through community groups, through community and local papers and lots of new media.’ Mr Hogan-Howe said: ‘There should be no more improper contact – that which is of a selfish, rather than a public interest. ‘Anyone found to have improperly shared information will be subject to misconduct and/or criminal proceedings.’\",\n",

              " '\\nWASHINGTON (AP) — Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump filed financial documents with federal campaign regulators on Wednesday and set his personal fortune at more than $10 billion with an annual income of more than $362 million. \\n  \\n FILE - In this June 29, 2015, file photo, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump smiles for a photographer before he addresses members of the City Club of Chicago, in Chicago. As other presidential... (Associated Press) \\n  \\n Members of his staff had said that Trump would release the financial documents themselves, but they issued only a press release that announced the filing and included a few financial details. It provided little information about how he calculated his net worth. \\n  \\n The $10 billion figure — up nearly 15 percent since the previous year, by Trump\\'s calculation — would make him the wealthiest person ever to run for president, far surpassing previous magnates like Ross Perot, business heirs like Steve Forbes or private-equity investors like Mitt Romney, the 2012 GOP nominee. \\n  \\n Among the sources of Trump\\'s income has been $214 million in payments from NBC related to 14 seasons of the business reality television show \"The Apprentice.\" NBC recently cut its ties with Trump following his controversial remarks about Mexican immigrants. \\n  \\n Trump is relying almost exclusively on his personal wealth to fund his White House bid. He has already lent his campaign $1.8 million, according to federal documents he filed Wednesday. His fortune could help maintain his status as a major player in the Republican presidential primary, much to the dismay of GOP officials who worry that his hardline immigration statements could alienate Hispanic voters. \\n  \\n Filing a personal financial disclosure with the Federal Election Commission is one of the requirements, set by the hosts, to participate in next month\\'s televised GOP debate. \\n  \\n Trump\\'s statement Wednesday noted that a hypothetical Trump building worth $1.5 billion would be reported as simply worth in excess of $50 million on the federal forms, which offer broad ranges for asset values. \\n  \\n Previous reviews of Trump\\'s real estate holdings by both Forbes Magazine and commercial real estate trade publication The Real Deal did not identify any single property with a valuation in excess of $1 billion. \\n  \\n His campaign noted that Trump held stakes in almost 500 business entities and said the federal forms are \"not designed for a man of Mr. Trump\\'s massive wealth.\" \\n  \\n \"I have a Gucci store worth more than Romney,\" Trump told the Des Moines Register last month, referring to the fashion company\\'s flagship store in New York\\'s Trump Tower. \\n  \\n Trump also valued his personal brand and marketing deals at $3.3 billion when he announced his candidacy. \\n  \\n Forbes Magazine, however, valued his brand at just $125 million. And that was before Trump\\'s comments about Mexican immigrants cost him business partnerships with companies such as Macy\\'s and Univision, which experts on brand valuation said have at least temporarily tarnished the value of his name in corporate sponsorship deals. \\n  \\n While the Forbes estimate is likely low, \"the spread between Forbes $125 million and his own estimate of $3.3 billion is explained primarily by hubris,\" said Weston Anson, chairman of Consor Intellectual Asset Management, a California-based consulting firm. \\n  \\n Anson said it was too early to evaluate the effect of Trump\\'s comments on value of his name, but noted the rapid cancellation of partnership and sponsorship deals. The notoriety could also likely erode Trump\\'s ability to charge a premium for his real estate, Anson said. \\n  \\n Trump in the past has taken umbrage at suggestions he might not be as fantastically wealthy as he says. In 2009, he sued author Timothy O\\'Brien for defamation after O\\'Brien wrote that Trump\\'s net worth might be as low as $150 million. \\n  \\n Trump lost the suit and a subsequent appeal. In a deposition, the panel of appellate judges noted, Trump conceded that his public disclosures of his wealth depended partly on his mood. \\n  \\n \"Even my own feelings affect my value to myself,\" Trump said. \\n  \\n ___ \\n  \\n Associated Press writers Frederic J.

But in the statement, Trump\\'s campaign itemized only about $50 million of his assets, including profits from stock sales and hedge and mutual fund investments. \\n  \\n Trump\\'s team also made a point to lament that the FEC\\'s personal financial disclosure form doesn\\'t allow for a full reflection of Trump\\'s cash. \\n  \\n \"This report was not designed for a man of Mr. Trump\\'s massive wealth,\" the press release stated. \"For instance, they have boxes once a certain number is reached that simply state $50 million or more.

              " 'Anti-gay activist George Alan Rekers contends in an earlier post on Riptide that he did not hire a young gay escort named Lucien as a prostitute. But what the minister -- who hasn\\'t returned calls seeking comment -- likely didn\\'t realize is that Miami New Times reporters were sitting beside Lucien during a candid conversation over speakerphone. \\n  \\n During that talk -- which took place at about 1 a.m. Thursday in a Fort Lauderdale home -- Rekers told Lucien several times not to talk to the press. He also never challenged two statements by Lucien: 1) that the minister had found the 20-year-old escort on an internet site, and 2) that they \"did the whole massage thing,\" referring to Lucien\\'s contention that he gave Rekers nude massages during their two-week trip to Europe. \\n  \\n (A statement on Rekers\\' website, professorgeorge.com, states that he \"did not find out about his travel assistant\\'s internet advertisements offering prostitution activity until after the trip was in progress\" and that he was not \"involved in sexual behavior with his travel assistant\".) \\n  \\n Lucien began the conversation in a state of mild panic, understandably worried by the explosion of publicity that followed New Times\\' original expose. (Lucien, who asked that his real name not be used, has never told his family he is gay, and prior to the story\\'s publication had declined to mention his line of work to many friends.) \\n  \\n Lucien was offended, too, by what he had learned from friends and press reports of Rekers\\' three decades of anti-gay activism, a record the Baptist minister tried to downplay. \\n  \\n \"I just stay in the background,\" said Rekers, a co-founder with James Dobson of the Family Research Council, a vehemently anti-gay lobbying group. Of gay people, he said: \"I\\'ve never picked a fight with them.\" \\n  \\n Rekers then said he has a \"friend in the media\" who\\'s advised him to avoid all contact with the press. Rekers told Lucien to do the same. \\n  \\n \"Tell them you don\\'t want to do interviews,\" said Rekers. \"Are they calling you on the phone, or calling you at your house?\" \\n  \\n \"Both!\" cried Lucien. \\n  \\n Throughout, Rekers was very solicitous, and Lucien was plainly upset. Lucien explained he\\'d felt extremely uncomfortable in his dealings with the press. \\n  \\n \"We did the whole massage thing,\" Lucien said, \"and I don\\'t know what to think about it.\" \\n  \\n \"Yeah,\" said Rekers, \"just say \\'no,\\' and just say \\'I\\'ve already [indecipherable] to the press,\\' and that\\'s it. \\'Cuz if you keep answering, it\\'ll keep the story alive.\" \\n  \\n \"This isn\\'t something I can just be silenced about!\" Lucien said moments later. \\n  \\n Rekers assured that if the escort just remained silent, the whole story would soon die down. He began muttering darkly about \"activists with an axe to grind\" and \"nothing better to do.\" \\n  \\n Lucien suggested that perhaps \"the media\" had a point and that Rekers really had done harm to the gay community. He insisted that Rekers\\' struggle wasn\\'t his, and said he had considered making a statement to the press. \\n  \\n \"Well, don\\'t do that,\" said Rekers. \"It just causes more harm.\" \\n  \\n \"What was going through your mind when you went on that website?\" demanded Lucien, referring to rentboy.com, the gay escort site where he had posted his profile. \\n  \\n Rekers paused for several seconds, considering. \"Well, I\\'d be happy to sit down and talk to you more about that.\" He paused again. \"We have to deal with the situation that we have, and make sure it doesn\\'t get worse.\" \\n  \\n \"Sometimes I feel like I should just tell [the press] what happened on the trip.\" \\n  \\n \"No,\" said Rekers quickly, \"Please don\\'t do that. Please don\\'t let them pressure you into it.\" \\n  \\n \"But I\\'m getting pressured out of the gay community!\" Lucien was fairly screaming now. \"If I ever wanted to be with someone -- it wouldn\\'t work out! This is my fucking name!\" \\n  \\n After some cross-talk, Rekers tried to calm Lucien down: \"I\\'ve been through things like this in the past --\" \\n  \\n Lucien cut him off: \"Well I haven\\'t! I\\'m 20 years old! If you\\'ve been through this, you shouldn\\'t have gone to that website, you shouldn\\'t have hired me -- why did you make so many choices [for me]?\" \\n  \\n The conversation was too sad, by then, and we couldn\\'t bear to follow it.

That\\'s the line being heroically maintained by George Rekers, the Baptist minister and vocal critic of gay rights, who was photographed returning from a 10-day European vacation with a male prostitute. It\\'s his story, and he\\'s sticking to it. \\n  \\n In an exclusive interview with The Independent, Dr Rekers, 61, who has three children and believes that homosexuality is a \"disease\" which can be cured, has explained the misunderstanding which saw him accidentally hire a blond Puerto Rican sex worker to help carry his bags during a trip to London and Madrid last month. \\n  \\n The prominent evangelical conservative, who co-founded the influential right-wing Family Research Council, became an international punch-line earlier this week when it emerged that his travelling companion was a 20-year-old escort who works under the aliases \"Lucien\" and \"Geo\" and advertises at www.rentboy.com. \\n  \\n Comedians including David Letterman and Jay Leno have gleefully joked about the exact nature of the baggage that Dr Rekers needed carrying. They have also pored over \"Lucien\\'s\" profile on the exotic site, where he\\'s described as \"un-cut\" and has listed his hobbies as \"vanilla, leather, shaving, spanking, role-play and go-go dancing.\" \\n  \\n Yet Dr Rekers vehemently denies any sexual relationship with the perfectly proportioned youth. Instead, he claims to have hired \"Lucien\" on doctors\\' orders, after surgery left him unable to lift heavy objects. He only discovered the true nature of \"Lucien\\'s\" profession halfway through the foreign trip, when it was too late to dispense with his professional services. \\n  \\n \"I still needed a travel assistant to assist me for the remainder of the trip and did not have time to find someone in Europe,\" Dr Rekers insisted yesterday. \\n  \\n \"My travel assistant was well behaved and never made any sexual advances to me. He was actually gone much of the day and night anyway, touring himself, when I did not need him. While the situation was certainly not ideal, I could adjust to it.\" \\n  \\n Dr Rekers was speaking from the University of South Carolina School of Medicine, where he describes himself as a \"distinguished professor of neuropsychiatry and behavioural science emeritus\" who is an expert lecturer on childhood and teenage sexuality. \\n  \\n A somewhat damning photograph of the duo at Miami International Airport published by the Miami New Times showed Dr Rekers arranging heavy bags on a luggage trolley, while \"Lucien\" stood decoratively to one side. However he insists that it does not undermine his version of events. \\n  \\n \"Pushing a trolley is not a problem for me,\" he said. \"My surgeon\\'s instructions are that I should not lift any object more than a few pounds because lifting is what would do damage to my body. My travel assistant lifted our suitcases from the conveyor belt and placed them on the trolley for me. He volunteered to push the trolley, which was nice but not necessary.\" \\n  \\n The big question now revolves around how exactly \"Lucien\" was hired. The New Times has quoted the sex worker claiming that Dr Rekers – who has appeared in court as an expert witness opposing gay adoption – had initially contacted him through www.rentboy.com. \\n  \\n But Dr Rekers strongly disputes this \"slanderous\" version of events. Although he refused to confirm or deny that he had ever visited the explicit website, which contains hundreds of pornographic images of men, he claims to have employed the travel assistant \"by interviewing different people who might be able to help\". \\n  \\n In fact, Dr Rekers maintains, he \"did not even find out about [the] prostitution activity until after the trip was in progress. There was nothing inappropriate with this relationship.\" \\n  \\n When the scandal first broke, Dr Rekers compared himself to the son of God, who is said to have broken bread with the prostitute Mary Magdalene. \"Like Jesus Christ,\" he told a reporter, he liked to spend time \"with sinners with the loving goal to try to help them\". \\n  \\n As to a leaked email he sent to \"Lucien\" discussing a second trip to Rome, which read: \"Wow! I\\'m so glad I met you!\" and announced that they would be sharing a twin bedroom, Dr Rekers claimed to again be the victim of \"misleading innuendo\". \\n  \\n That message, he said, was sent \"before the 30 March departure to Madrid on which he assisted me, and before I found out about his internet advertisements offering prostitution activity, which I discovered after the trip was in progress.\" |||||',\n",
              " '\\nStudy suggests indoor tanning beds and childhood sunburns may be to blame for rising skin cancer rates.\\n\\nSkin cancer is on the rise among young adults, according to a study published Monday that suggests indoor tanning beds and childhood sunburns may be to blame.\\n\\nBetween 1970 and 2009, the rate of melanoma among women increased eightfold and quadrupled among men, according to the research by Mayo Clinic experts who studied all medical records for a county in Minnesota over that timespan.\\n\\nHowever, death rates from melanoma fell during the same period, suggesting that early interventions may be helping to save some lives, said the researchers.\\n\\nStill, lead investigator Jerry Brewer, M.D., a Mayo Clinic dermatologist, sounded the alarm about what he called a \"dramatic rise in women in their 20s and 30s.\"\\n\\n\"We anticipated we\\'d find rising rates, as other studies are suggesting, but we found an even higher incidence than the National Cancer Institute had reported,\" he said.\\n\\nAlthough the current study did not focus on reasons for the increase, Brewer said other researchers have found that people who use indoor tanning beds are 74 percent more likely to get melanoma than non-tanners.\\n\\nJennifer Stein, a dermatologist at New York University Langone Medical Center, agreed that indoor tanning beds are a likely culprit.\\n\\nHOW TO DO A SKIN SELF EXAM\\n\\n\"One possible explanation for this rapid increase in cases of melanoma may be the use of indoor tanning beds in teens and young adults, which has become so popular in recent years,\" said Stein, who was not involved with the study.\\n\\n\"It\\'s important for people to protect their skin from ultraviolet exposure, and to check their skin for new or changing moles, which can be a sign of melanoma.

Thousands of pro-Russian activists this afternoon stormed the police station in the Black Sea port, where dozes of people were killed in riots two days ago. Protesters forced open the gate to the complex and smashed windows, fighting police in riot gear who seemed reluctant to strike back against their countrymen. 'Freedom fighter': A man cries after being released from a local police station which was stormed by pro-Russian protesters in Odessa, Ukraine. Two sides: The protesters can be seen surrounding a Ukrainian policeman outside the Odessa police department. In the firing line: A young journalist is being cared for my volunteers after being shot in the leg outside the Odessa Police's headquarters. Protesters welcome a man who just released from Odessa's police headquarters who had been arrested in street battles between pro-Russian and pro-Ukrainian supporters in the Black Sea port on Friday. Emotional: The men were released after thousands of people descended on the heaquarters and laid siege to it. Pro-Russian protesers storm the police headquarters in Odessa to free fellow activists arrested on Friday. The prisoners released this afternoon. were those held during fierce clashes between pro-Russian and pro-Kiev. groups which led to 47 deaths on Friday night. The. trouble in hitherto peaceful Odessa, where many citizens speak Russian,. comes as forces loyal to the new government in Kiev carry out a major. offensive against separatists who have seized control of towns and. cities in the east of the country. Last night the Kremlin said that Russian. President Vladimir Putin is ‘outraged’ by the violence in Ukraine and. is under huge pressure to send in tanks as the country lurches towards. civil war, the Kremlin warned last night. Amid. the deepening violence and bloodshed, Moscow flexed its muscles by. demanding that presidential elections scheduled for May 25 be postponed. The. government in Kiev declared two days of mourning for Ukrainian troops. killed in the eastern city of Slaviansk and for victims of protests in. Odessa – including pro-Russian activists killed in attacks by Ukrainian. extremist groups. Police try to contain the surging mob with a line of riot shields after protesters gain access to the compound. Mob rule: Protesters forced open the gate to the complex and smashed windows, fighting police in riot gear who seemed reluctant to strike back against their countrymen.

A pro-Russian activist argues with policemen guarding the burned-out building after thousands descended on the scene of Friday's violence to lay flowers and light candles of remembrance. Flower power: A policeman raises his arm to defend himself from a woman battering him with blooms. Western countries blame Moscow for inciting the mayhem now raging across Ukraine, and US President Barack Obama has threatened a new round of sanctions against Russia. But a senior Russian diplomat, UN envoy Vitaly Churkin, said yesterday that the carnage in Odessa – a Ukrainian city far from the eastern areas held\\xa0 by rebels – was ‘reminiscent of the crimes of the Nazis from whom the Ukrainian ultra-nationalists derive their ideological inspiration’. Ukrainian security officials accused close aides of ex-president Viktor Yanukovych, now exiled in Russia, of financing the violence in Odessa on Friday, which led to the deaths of 46 people in a burning building. Another 200 were injured in the blaze, which is believed to have been started by petrol bombs thrown by demonstrators. Former prime minister Yulia Tymoshenko, who is standing in the presidential election, blamed Russian intelligence agencies for the unrest, and said Mr Putin was trying to destabilise her country. In Moscow, government spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Mr Putin had received ‘thousands’ of demands to intervene in Ukraine. Destruction: A police bus outside the station has been destroyed by protesters in Odessa. Putin fans: Pro-Russian protesters attend a rally near a barricade in front of the occupied regional administration building in Donetsk. A large crowd gathered for a memorial service in honour of the victims of the burned trade union building in Odessa on Sunday, the day after brutal clashes claimed 42 lives. In mourning: Relatives hang a Russian flag on the facade of the charred trade union building which saw lives lost on both sides of the conflict. Tragedy: A woman cries in front of the trade union building in Odessa as police troops guard what remains of it. Street soldiers: Victim of the Trade Union building fire recover in one of the burn unit wards at Yevreyskaya hospital in Odessa. ‘People are calling in despair, asking for help,’ he said. ‘The overwhelming majority demand Russian help. All these calls are reported to Vladimir Putin.’ Demanding the presidential election be. shelved, Mr Peskov said that after Kiev’s ‘criminal confrontation with. its own people’, Russians ‘do not understand what kind of elections. Kiev, European countries and Washington are talking about’. More than 60,000 Russian troops have been moved to the border with Ukraine and the newly annexed Crimea. After. street clashes in Odessa on Friday, a Ukrainian mob overran and set. fire to a camp where pro-Moscow supporters had pitched tents, forcing. them to take refuge in a trade union building which was then set ablaze. Many of those trapped inside the burning offices were killed by smoke. and fumes, according to harrowing accounts yesterday. Local. journalist Oleg Konstantinov, who suffered gunshot wounds in the melee,. said: ‘I was hit in the arm, then I started crawling, and then got hit. in the back and leg.’ Probe: German Defence Minister Ursula von der Leyen and the freed OSCE observer, Axel Schneider (second from right), talk after his arrival following his release from captivity. Colonel Schneider, left, is embraced by Vacheslav Ponomarev, the pro-Russian self-proclaimed mayor of Slaviansk, after he and 11 other military observers were freed in the city after being held for a week. Forces: Ukrainian soldiers, supported by armoured personnel carriers, man a checkpoint near the town of Slaviansk. A young lookout holds binoculars at a checkpoint near Slaviansk, where Ukrainian soldiers fought fierce battles with rebels yesterday, punctuated only by a short ceasefire to allow OSCE observers to leave the town. A man shows bullet casings that he says were shot by Ukrainian troops near the town of Slaviansk. A man walks past the charred skeleton of a van outside the hotel Kramatorsk in downtown of Kramatorsk. Local residents say Ukrainian government troops opened fire on a crowd of unarmed protesters. Separatist militias armed with assault rifles, a machine gun and a grenade launcher rest in Kramatorsk. Fire: A pro-Russian activist burns a Ukrainian national flag as security documents are seized from the Ukrainian regional office of the Security Service in Donetsk. Demonstration: Pro-Russian protesters break up the words 'Ukrainian the Security Service' next to the Ukrainian regional office of the Security Service in Donetsk. Mob: A pro Russian woman burns books taken from the Ukrainian regional office in Donetsk. A female doctor who escaped the. burning building said: ‘I nearly suffocated. There was no place to. escape, people were cornered. People close to me were moaning, crying. and calling their relatives, begging them to call the fire brigade.’ Eventually. she and others escaped down a rope from a window, but others fell and. their bodies were later found in the street. ‘For the first time in my. life I want to leave Odessa and Ukraine forever,’ the doctor added. One. positive sign yesterday was the release of seven international military. observers working for the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in. Europe. The group had been held for a week and were accused of being. Nato spies. In a statement, Russia’s foreign ministry said their release showed the ‘bravery and humanism’ of the defenders\\xa0 of Slaviansk. The. ministry said people there had shown concern for the security of. foreign citizens, despite their town coming under ‘direct and. unmotivated’ attack.\",\n",

Winfrey, chief executive officer of the television channel Oprah Winfrey Network, bought “Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer II” for $87.9 million in 2006 at Christie’s in New York -- still an auction record for the Austrian artist. Since then, its value has risen about 71 percent. \\n  \\n Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer II by Klimt Source: Neue Galerie New York \\n  \\n The work is the second major Klimt that changed hands since the art market started contracting. Russian billionaire Dmitry Rybolovlev sold “Water Serpents II” (1904-1907) privately for $170 million in November 2015, according to Sandy Heller, Rybolovlev’s art consultant. Both Klimts went to Asia, where booming wealth has built a growing network of collectors eager to anchor their art holdings with Western masterpieces. \\n  \\n “Klimt is on the list of some people,” said Grace Rong Li, who advises Asian collectors on Western modern and contemporary art. The appeal of the artist, known for his golden-hued “The Kiss,” is both aesthetic and financial, she added. \\n  \\n “Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer II,” from 1912, depicts a woman in a long, narrow robe and halo-like black hat, standing against an ornate background of mauve and green. The subject, Bloch-Bauer, was the wife of a Jewish industrialist and art patron in Vienna. \\n  \\n Geffen Connection \\n  \\n In 2014, Winfrey lent the painting anonymously to the Museum of Modern Art for five years, according to the person, who asked not to be identified because the information is confidential. The loan was arranged by entertainment mogul David Geffen, who is Winfrey’s friend and a benefactor of the museum, the person said. \\n  \\n Representatives for Winfrey and Geffen declined to comment. \\n  \\n While the Klimt was hanging at MOMA’s fifth-floor galleries last year, Winfrey was approached through Geffen by art dealer Larry Gagosian, who had a potential buyer lined up, said the person. Winfrey was willing to let it go for $150 million, according to the person. \\n  \\n Before she sold the work to an unidentified Chinese buyer during the summer, Winfrey agreed to temporarily lend it to Neue Galerie for the exhibition “ Klimt and the Women of Vienna’s Golden Age, 1900–1918,” which ran from Sept. 22 to Jan. 16. \\n  \\n Gagosian’s representatives didn’t respond to requests for comment. \\n  \\n The canvas was part of a cache looted by the Nazis and famously restituted by the Austrian government to Bloch-Bauer’s heirs in 2006. The legal battle over the works inspired “Woman in Gold,” a 2015 movie starring Helen Mirren. \\n  \\n Two Takes \\n  \\n The trove included two formal portraits of Bloch-Bauer made by Klimt. \\n  \\n The painting Winfrey sold will be featured with its predecessor at Neue Galerie, billionaire Ronald Lauder’s private museum in New York, through July. Lauder paid a reported $135 million in 2006 for “Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer I,” at the time the highest price for any artwork, and the gold-ground 1907 painting became his museum’s crown jewel. The show has brought a reunion, as both portraits spent decades at the Belvedere Museum in Vienna. \\n  \\n “Adele Bloch-Bauer is the only subject Klimt is known to have portrayed twice -- first in the iconic 1907 ‘golden’ portrait, then in 1912 in a very different, exuberantly colored work,” said Scott Gutterman, deputy director of Neue Galerie. “Seeing the two works side by side allows the viewer to see how Klimt’s work changed during this key period in his artistic development.” \\n  \\n Watch Next: Why a Pile of Car Parts Is a Steal at $4.5 Million ||||| The portrait began with a commission by the husband of the artist's alleged lover, and underwent a Nazi theft, a legal feud and a deal brokered by Larry Gagosian for Winfrey that is likely the biggest private sale of a single artwork in 2016. \\n  \\n Oprah Winfrey has a long list of accomplishments. Being the seller of one of the top 10 most expensive paintings in history is now one of them. \\n  \\n The OWN network founder and multibillionaire reportedly sold Gustav Klimt’s “Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer II” (1912) for $150 million to an unidentified buyer in China, according to Bloomberg’s art market reporter Katya Kazakina, who spoke to a person with knowledge of the deal. \\n  \\n Winfrey purchased the work at Christie’s on Nov. 8, 2006, for $87.9 million, an auction record for a work by Klimt that still stands, giving Winfrey a $62.1 million profit on the sale. It’s likely that this was the biggest private sale of a single artwork in 2016. \\n  \\n Larry Gagosian, who had approached Winfrey with the information that he had a buyer who was interested, reportedly brokered the deal. \\n  \\n The painting is one of two portraits done of Adele Bloch-Bauer, the hostess of a famed Viennese salon in the early 20th century. Adele and her husband Ferdinand Bloch-Bauer were two of the biggest art patrons in Vienna at the time. Ferdinand commissioned Klimt, a regular at the salon, to paint a portrait of his wife first in 1903, and then again in 1912. There were unsubstantiated rumors of an affair between Adele Bloch-Bauer and Klimt at the time. \\n  \\n When Adele Bloch-Bauer died suddenly of meningitis in 1925 at the age of 43, the paintings were displayed in the Bloch-Bauer’s Klimt gallery as a memorial of sorts. They remained there until Nazi Germany annexed Austria in 1938, whereupon Ferdinand fled to Prague, the mansion was looted and the paintings stolen. Belvedere Gallery, the Austrian state museum, acquired the Klimts in 1941. When Ferdinand died in 1945, he bequeathed the estate to his nieces and nephews, including Maria Altmann. \\n  \\n That set up a legal fight between the heirs to the paintings and the Austrian government, who were loathe to give up such important works by a Viennese artist. Altmann’s legal battle, The Republic of Austria vs. Altmann (2004), for ownership of the paintings was made into the 2015 film Woman in Gold, starring Helen Mirren as Altmann and Ryan Reynolds as her attorney. Three other documentary films — The Rape of Europa (2006), Stealing Klimt (2007) and Adele’s Wish (2008) — feature the legal battle prominently. \\n  \\n Now both works have left Vienna altogether. Ronald Lauder, son of Estee and Joseph Lauder, founders of the Estee Lauder Companies, purchased “Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer I” for $135 million in 2006, and has displayed it in his private museum dedicated to Austrian and German art from the 20th century, the Neue Galerie on Manhattan’s Upper East Side, ever since. \\n  \\n It is known that Winfrey has long been an art collector, but not much is known about what works she owns. She has been photographed in front of a work by quilt artist Faith Ringgold, and pieces by sculptor Gaston Lachaise and painters Thomas Hart Benton and Harry Roseland have been photographed in her home. In 2015, Winfrey held an auction at Leslie Hindman Auctioneers, selling furniture and porcelain, along with works by the likes of Hovseo Pushman and Richard Edward Miller. \\n  \\n Auction houses have been reported low sales in recent years, and large-scale pieces have started to change hands in private sales. In 2015, David Geffen sold two paintings, “Interchange” by Willem de Kooning and “Number 17A” by Jackson Pollock, for $500 million, the largest private sale of art to date. Also in 2015, Russian billionaire Dmitry Rybolovlev sold the Klimt painting “Water Serpents II” (1904 – 1907) to a collector in China for $170 million. \\n  \\n The Klimt painting spent some time at the Museum of Modern Art in New York, hanging on MOMA’s fifth floor gallery. Winfrey in loaned it to the museum a deal put together by Geffen, a longtime friend of Winfrey’s. \\n  \\n Currently, both portraits of Adele Bloch-Bauer hang side-by-side at Lauder’s Neue Galerie in the exhibition Austrian Masterworks from the Neue Galerie New York, where it will remain on loan until Sept. 25, 2017. We recommend you go see it now, as it may be a long time before it’s available to the public again. ||||| Austrian Masterworks from the Neue Galerie New York \\n  \\n This exhibition celebrates the fifteenth anniversary of the Neue Galerie’s founding. Highlights from the museum’s extensive collection of Austrian art from the period 1890 to 1940 are on view, including major paintings and drawings by Gustav Klimt, Oskar Kokoschka, Alfred Kubin, and Egon Schiele. Icons of modern design are also featured, such as furniture designed by architects Otto Wagner and Adolf Loos, as well as objects made by the Wiener Werkstätte after designs by Josef Hoffmann, Koloman Moser, and Dagobert Peche. \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n The center gallery features an extraordinary selection of Klimt’s sensuous depictions of women, including both portraits of Adele Bloch-Bauer (1907 and 1912), as well as paintings of Gertha Loew (1902), and Ria Munk (1917). This special presentation includes four major loans that have been extended following the recent exhibition, “Klimt and the Women of Vienna’s Golden Age, 1900-1918.” The Neue Galerie appreciates the generosity of the private lenders who made this presentation possible, which offers a rare opportunity to see some of Klimt’s most important and beloved canvases. Special thanks are due to Neue Galerie President and co-founder Ronald S. Lauder. \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n A fully-illustrated catalogue, published by Prestel Verlag, accompanies the exhibition, featuring a major overview of of the Neue Galerie's holdings of fine art and design from Germany and Austria. \\n  \\n This exhibition is made possible in part by the Neue Galerie President’s Circle. ||||| The seller of Gustav Klimt’s strikingly colorful portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer, which traded hands last summer for $150 million, is billionaire entertainment mogul Oprah Winfrey, according to a report by Bloomberg’s Katya Kazakina. The private sale, to a Chinese collector, was brokered by dealer Larry Gagosian and businessman David Geffen. \\n  \\n Winfrey bought “Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer II” (1912) at Christie’s landmark November 8, 2006 sale for $87.9 million (an auction record for the Vienna Secession artist that still stands). She recently (anonymously) loaned it to the Neue Galerie for the exhibition Klimt and the Women of Vienna’s Golden Age, 1900–1918, where it hung alongside Klimt’s other portrait of Bloch-Bauer, the iconic, gold-hued “Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer I” from 1907, which the museum’s founder, Ronald Lauder, bought in 2006 for a reported $135 million — at the time, the highest price ever paid for an artwork. Both works were part of a set of Nazi-looted paintings that were restituted to Bloch-Bauer’s heirs in 2006. The legal battle to secure the works’ return from the Austrian government was the subject of the 2015 film starring Helen Mirren and Ryan Reynolds titled Woman in Gold. \\n  \\n The painting recently sold by Winfrey will remain on view at the Neue Galerie, as part of the exhibition Austrian Masterworks from the Neue Galerie New York, through September 25. After that, it may not go on public view again until the day it turns up in the anonymous buyer’s private museum. |||||\",\n",

              " 'You need to have a copy of the song already on your computer in order to make your video. If you do not have the music file, you can buy it or download it online. Common pictures include album artwork, shots of the band playing music, hanging out, and at live shows, and images that relate to the words currently being sung. You can even choose to put lyrics up as they\\'re sung in certain moments. There is no wrong series of pictures to put up, but you should think about what the song says to you and how you want to portray it.  The most popular videos have photos that fit seamlessly with the music being played. Think of a theme or story in advance that you want to tell. You can use pictures from your own life or those found online. Know, however, that it is illegal to profit off of someone else\\'s work, so you cannot charge people for the music video unless the pictures and song are all your own. Make a folder labeled \"Music Video\" on your desktop. As you find photos, pull them into this folder. If everything is in the same place to begin with, your life will be much easier in the future. Good places to find photos include:  Stock photography sites. Your own collections. Online image searches. The musician\\'s bio or photo page. You can use almost any video editing software you want, from Windows MovieMaker and iMovie, to Avid and Final Cut, as these videos are simple and can be handled by most software. You can even use the most recent version of Powerpoint on Open Office, which can save presentations as movies. Click and drag your song into the timeline to determine the length of your video. This process is slightly different for each program, but you should end up with each photo end to end on your editing timeline. The first shot should be lined up with the start of the song. Usually you can click and drag the files right from your folder into the editing program. If this doesn\\'t work, try \"File\" → \"Import,\" then find the photos. Click and drag them after importing into the video work station. To determine the number of seconds, simply multiply 60 by the number of minutes in the song, then add the leftover seconds. Therefore, a 2:40 long song would be 160 seconds long (60x2=120, + 40 = 160). Divide this number by your photos to determine the total length of each shot. For example, if you had 80 photos for a 160 second song, you\\'d need each photo to last for two seconds to fit the whole video. If you want some photos to go longer than others, you can simply use this as a guideline. Simply start with the appropriate number of seconds per photo, then adjust individual photos by hand. Click on all the photos by either dragging and highlighting, or Shift+Click. Right click on them and choose, \"Set Length of Clips.\" Choose right amount of time for your video, depending on what you tested earlier.  It may not be labeled as \"Set Length of Clips,\" but it will be similar. Some other possibilities are: \"Duration,\" \"Clip Length,\" or \"Clip Timing.\" Some programs, like iMovie, let you change the duration of all stills, by default, in \"Preferences.\" Simply set \"Duration of Stills\" to your desired length. Once you\\'ve finished your video, click on Save As or Export and choose and MP4 or MOV (Quicktime) file. These are the easiest to get onto YouTube, and they will not take up a lot of space on your computer. Exporting is when you take the video project and convert it into a full movie. If you don\\'t get an option for MP4 under \"Save As,\" you\\'ll likely need to export. You\\'ll need to make an account. From their you can click on \"Upload\" to put your video up on the internet for all to see.

              " 'On Tuesday morning Whoopi Goldberg and the hosts of The View announced that Marvel will relaunch Thor this October with a \\'worthy\\' woman brandishing the hammer . Marvel followed that announcement with two more high profile switcheroos on Wednesday night as Entertainment Weekly revealed a new-ish and possibly superior Iron Man , and Marvel Chief Creative Officer Joe Quesada joined comedian Stephen Colbert on The Colbert Report to announce that a new guy will take up Captain America\\'s shield. \\n  \\n That in itself isn\\'t much of a surprise -- original Cap Steve Rogers has passed on his mantle a few times, before eventually yanking it back. After spending some time in Dimension Z and fighting the Iron Nail and whatnot, he\\'s now too old to Avenge from the front lines. The big reveal is that the new Captain America will be Sam Wilson, the African-American superhero currently known as Falcon . \\n  \\n It\\'s not hard to guess at Marvel\\'s intentions here. By announcing a female Thor and a black Captain America as a swift one-two punch, the publisher accomplishes two things. First, it shakes up its universe in a way that\\'s sure to garner attention -- as indeed it has. Second, it makes a mission statement. \\n  \\n To the first point; the whole world knows Marvel\\'s Avengers characters now. That could be a millstone around the publisher\\'s neck if Marvel put the need to reflect the movies ahead of a need to tell its own stories. Marvel has certainly tried to configure Avengers comics around the on-screen characters, but to no particular success with respect to sales (certainly nothing to indicate that the Avengers are the most popular movie characters in America). \\n  \\n Replacing at least two of its Avengers big three -- Thor, Captain America, and Iron Man -- suggests Marvel\\'s commitment to telling its own stories, albeit in a grandstanding, headline-grabbing way. A woman taking the name and role of a male Norse god? A black man representing all of America? These are moves that upset the right people, and that guarantees attention. \\n  \\n Which leads in to the second point. These changes suggest an agenda. I\\'d call it progressive agenda, but it\\'s not. Putting women and people of color in key positions isn\\'t progressive, it\\'s just evidence that superhero comics are slowly catching up to the present day. It just happens that there\\'s a strong regressive agenda in our culture that\\'s resistant to that kind of change. \\n  \\n Marvel\\'s only motive here may be to stir up controversy and hope it translates to sales, but I think there\\'s enough evidence in the publisher\\'s support for books like Ms. Marvel , Captain Marvel , and Mighty Avengers , that the publisher is sincere in its efforts to reach out to audiences that traditionally haven\\'t been well-served by superhero comics. There\\'s always more work to be done, but Marvel\\'s output feels more inclusive with every passing quarter. \\n  \\n Even before tonight\\'s announcement there was a heavy hint that we\\'d soon see a black Captain America in one of Marvel\\'s house ads. The same ad offered readers their first glimpse of \"unworthy\" one-armed Thor. \\n  \\n The smart bet was always that this was Sam Wilson in the image, but there\\'s no shortage of heroes of color who could have stepped into Captain America\\'s shoes. There was one previous black Captain America, Isaiah Bradley, introduced by Kyle Baker and the late Robert Morales in the mini-series Truth: Red, White And Black in 2003. Isaiah, his son Josiah, or his grandson Elijah -- Patriot of the Young Avengers -- would all be plausible candidates for the role of Captain America. \\n  \\n Luke Cage or America Chavez could also comfortably take the role, but the preview image clearly doesn\\'t show either of them. Another former Captain America sidekick, Lemar Hoskins, aka Battlestar, has never really had his due, perhaps in part because the Cap he was affiliated with was another substitute shield-holder, John Walker, later U.S. Agent. \\n  \\n We now have it confirmed that Sam Wilson will be the new Cap. It\\'s tempting to laud this as an unambiguously positive development, and certainly a black Captain America has the power to inspire readers the way Miles Morales has done as the black Spider-Man in Marvel\\'s Ultimate universe. \\n  \\n Yet this is the Marvel universe, and the laws of elasticity are in play there as much as they are in DC Comics\\' universe. Every substitute hero in an iconic role carries an expiry date. At a certain point, Thor will be a man again. At a certain point, Captain America will be white again. In the short term these characters send the welcome message that women and people of color can be the equal of the white dudes that dominate superhero fiction. \\n  \\n And in the long term, they suggest that they can\\'t be, because in the long term they don\\'t get to be. Female Thor and black Captain America are great inspirations as long as they\\'re around, but when they inevitably leave and the primacy of white men reasserts itself, the after-taste will be bitter. \\n  \\n A black or female hero in a temporary role will never be as powerful a symbol as a black or female hero with their own indelible, permanent identity. In the case of Sam Wilson, it\\'s especially frustrating to see him lined up as the latest of Steve Rogers\\' \"successors\" when, thanks to his extremely well received appearance in the movie Captain America: The Winter Soldier , his identity as Falcon has never had more cachet. Perhaps a stint as Cap will boost his profile and his résumé in the long term, but in the short term it\\'s frustrating that Marvel isn\\'t throwing its weight behind a Falcon ongoing series at a time when demand presumably couldn\\'t be higher. \\n  \\n It\\'s also frustrating that Marvel hasn\\'t seen fit to put a black creator on its new Captain America title, instead opting for current series writer Rick Remender and incoming artist Stuart Immonen . That\\'s not to suggest that Remender isn\\'t talented or deserving -- indeed, his Dimension Z storyline of Captain America earned a place on ComicsAlliance\\'s list of the best comics of 2013 , as did Immonen\\'s work on All-New X-Men -- or even to suggest that a black creative team is necessary for a book with a black lead. But when black creators aren\\'t even represented on books with black lead characters, that undermines any message a publisher might want to send about its commitment to diverse audiences. People from those audiences have plenty to say. They deserve the chance to say it, and audiences deserve to hear it. \\n  \\n Despite those many caveats, the introduction of a black Captain America is a welcome development on its own terms because of what it suggests about Marvel\\'s commitment to storytelling and inclusion. If Marvel could demonstrate the same commitment to elevating black characters with their own identities and hiring black creators to tell their own stories, this could be an across-the-board win for the publisher. \\n  \\n Sara Pichelli \\n  \\n Now all eyes turn to Iron Man, the third member of Marvel\\'s core Avengers triumvirate. Was there any chance Tony Stark wouldn\\'t have a replacement before the week is out? Well, we now know Marvel plans to relaunch Iron Man as Superior Iron Man , a new series by Tom Taylor and Yildiray Cinar, and Entertainment Weekly clearly identifies the title character as Tony Stark. But Marvel Editor-in-Chief Axel Alonso hinted at the intentionally foreboding implications of the \"superior\" descriptor -- used very recently to identify the \"evil\" wall-crawler Superior Spider-Man when his role was assumed by villain Doctor Octopus. \"Like the Superior Spider-Man, Superior Iron Man is a character that’s hard to root for,\" Alonso told EW. \\n  \\n All-New Captain America , Thor and Superior Iron Man are all part of an initiative Marvel\\'s calling Avengers NOW, which EW suggests will see more titles added to the line as time goes on. This promo image reflects some of these changes, and also puts to rest a popular theory about the new Thor: she\\'s definitely not Angela. Unless she is Angela, and Marvel placed her right beside the new Thor as a dirty trick to throw everybody off. \\n  \\n The last bit of race-swapping superhero news is decidedly more grim: Stephen Colbert is the new Falcon. ||||| Share. Does Marvel still need Steve Rogers? Does Marvel still need Steve Rogers? \\n  \\n Beware of spoilers from Captain America\\'s comic book! \\n  \\n It seems we may be due for a new Captain America soon. For those not following Rick Remender\\'s Captain America series, Steve Rogers has lost the Super-Soldier Serum that transformed him into a Nazi-punching machine. He\\'s back to being puny again, which combined with his old age doesn\\'t make for prime superhero material. Over the next couple months the series will follow Steve\\'s journey as he picks out potential replacements and transitions into more of a strategist role among the Avengers. That culminates with Captain America #25 in September, which will debut a new Captain America to the world. \\n  \\n Of course, plenty of readers have already pointed out how it wasn\\'t that long ago that we got a new Captain America. In fact, it was another Captain America #25 (Vol. 5 rather than the current Vol. 7) wherein Steve Rogers was seemingly assassinated as he awaited trial for his crimes during Marvel\\'s Civil War storyline. The series then followed the recently de-brainwashed Bucky Barnes as he came to grips with his friend\\'s death and eventually agreed to take up the mantle himself. It was a status quo shift that lasted a couple years longer than anyone could have reasonably expected, with Bucky not giving up the shield until he had his own brush with fake death in Fear Itself. \\n  \\n Normally, this might all be cause for a speculative article about whom the new Captain America might be. But what would be the point? Marvel isn\\'t exactly hiding the fact that Sam Wilson - a.k.a. The Falcon - will be the next to don the patriotic suit. We know because he already has on this cover to Avengers #35: \\n  \\n You can read more about that issue and the \"Time Runs Out\" storyline here, but the gist is that the series is jumping ahead and showing us what the rest of the Marvel Universe will be like as of next May. The Falcon is apparently becoming Captain America, and Steve\\'s new status quo as a decrepit monkey skeleton isn\\'t going to be fixed anytime soon. Both characters will be in these new roles for a while. But my question is simple. Why not make this a permanent change? \\n  \\n I loved Brubaker\\'s Cap saga for many reasons, but chief among them was the fact that it was really a story about Bucky, not Steve Rogers. Taking Steve off the board and creating a new Cap was the most interesting thing that had happened to the franchise since Cap-Wolf. It allowed a Marvel comic to explore the idea of a superhero legacy in a way that usually only DC does. And in a genre where change is transient and most deaths or major status quo upheavals are undone within a matter of months, it was refreshing to see Brubaker make such a fundamental change to Captain America and actually have it last several years. Ultimately, though, things reverted more or less to normal. Steve abandoned his post as the new Nick Fury and became Cap full-time again. Bucky went back to being a shadowy assassin. It was to be expected, but that didn\\'t make it any less disappointing. \\n  \\n Here\\'s the problem with Steve Rogers. He\\'s one of Marvel\\'s oldest superhero characters, dating all the way back to 1941\\'s Captain America Comics #1. Hailing as he does from that simpler era, Steve isn\\'t the deepest Marvel character. He doesn\\'t have the pathos of Spider-Man, the badboy charm of Wolverine, or the fourth wall-breaking humor of Deadpool. Even compared to his fellow Golden Age Marvel heroes, Steve is a little plain. At least the original Human Torch has his Pinocchio syndrome. And Namor? He\\'s gotten by all these years by being a complete jerk to everyone he comes in contact with. Steve Rogers is just a good, honest kid who desperately wanted the chance to defend his country and found it. \\n  \\n Steve did take on new depth when he was dusted off in 1964\\'s Avengers #4. His \"man out of time\" conflict became the hero\\'s core struggle. But while fans can argue about exactly how much time has passed in the Marvel Universe since the Fantastic Four appeared to kickstart \"The Heroic Age,\" it\\'s obviously been long enough for Steve Rogers to adjust to life in the 21st Century. So what exactly is his defining struggle now? Remender tried to turn that conflict on its head with the \"Castaway in Dimension Z\" storyline. There, Steve was trapped in another dimension for a decade, only to return to Earth and find that little time had passed back home. It was a valiant attempt to inject some new life into an old jalopy, but I don\\'t think it was enough. |||||',\n",

My main problem with these type of movies is simply the music. I like all kinds of music, from Albinoni to ZZ Top, but Broadway show tunes in swing time with never-ending pah-pah-tah-dah trumpet flourishes at the end of every fourth bar aren't my cup of tea. This was written by the tag team of Frank Loesser, Mankiewicz, Jo Swerling and Abe Burrows (based on a couple of Damon Runyon stories), and while the plot is quite affable the songs are weak. Blaine's two numbers for example are identical, unnecessary, don't advance the plot and grate on the ears (and are also flagrantly misogynistic if that sort of thing bothers you). There are only two memorable tunes, Luck Be A Lady (sung by Brando, not Sinatra as you might expect) and Sit Down, You're Rockin' The Boat (nicely performed by Kaye) but you have to sit through two hours to get to them. The movie's trump card is a young Brando giving a thoughtful, laid-back performance; he also sings quite well and even dances a little, and is evenly matched with the always interesting Simmons. The sequence where the two of them escape to Havana for the night is a welcome respite from all the noise, bustle and vowel-murdering of Noo Yawk. Fans of musicals may dig this, but in my view a musical has to do something more than just film the stage show.\",\n",

              " 'While “synthesizer” is used synonymously with “electronic musical instrument,” the synthesizer is the part of the electronic instrument that produces the actual music: the beats, the rhythms, and the tones.  Early synthesizers, such as the Moog Minimoog, were capable of producing only one tone at a time (monophonic). These synthesizers could not produce the secondary tones that other musical instruments could, although some synthesizers could produce two pitches at once if two keys were pressed. From the mid-1970s on, synthesizers that can produce multiple tones at once (polyphonic) have been available, allowing you to produce chords as well as individual notes.  Most early synthesizers were separate from the means used to control the sounds they made. Many electronic musical instruments, particularly those for casual home use, now feature the synthesizer physically integrated with its control unit. The earliest synthesizers were controlled by flipping switches, turning knobs, or in the case of the Theremin (what the Etherophone was renamed), by where the operator’s hands were positioned over the instrument. Modern controllers come in more musician-friendly varieties and control the synthesizer through the Musical Instrumental Digital Interface (MIDI) standard. Some of the controllers are described below:  Keyboard. This is the most common synthesizer controller. Keyboards range in size from the full 88-key (7-octave) keyboard found on digital pianos to as few as 25 keys (2 octaves) on a toy-sized keyboard. Keyboards for home use typically have 49, 61, or 76 keys (4, 5, or 6 octaves). Some keyboards feature weighted keys to simulate the responsiveness of a piano, while others feature spring-loaded keys, and still others combine springs with lighter weights than fully weighted keys.. Many feature touch sensitivity, where the hardness of the keys (how hard they are struck) determines how loud the sound generated is. Mouthpiece/wind controller. This controller is found on a wind synthesizer, an electronic instrument designed similar to a soprano saxophone, clarinet, recorder, or trumpet. You blow into it to regulate the sound, which can be modified by using your thumb or jaw in certain ways.  MIDI guitar. This is software that lets you use your acoustic or electric guitar, with a pickup, to control a synthesizer. MIDI guitars work by attempting to convert string vibrations into digital data. There is often a delay between the input and output because of the amount of sampling necessary to create the digitized sound.  SynthAxe: No longer made, the SynthAxe worked by dividing the fretboard into 6 diagonal zones and used the strings as sensors. How much bending the strings were subjected to determined the tone generated.  Keytar: This controller is shaped like the body and neck of a guitar, but has a 3-octave keyboard on the guitar body and other sound-manipulating controls on the neck. Inspired by an 18th-century instrument called the orphica, it offers players the control of a keyboard and the mobility of a guitar.  Electronic drum pads: Introduced in 1971, electronic drum pads are usually available in kits similar to that of acoustic drums, including cymbals. Early versions played pre-recorded samples, while later versions create the sounds mathematically. Used with headphones, it is possible to play an electronic drum kit so that only the player hears the sound it makes.  Radio drum. Originally intended for use as a three-dimensional “mouse,” the radio drum senses the position of its two sticks in three dimensions, varying the sound produced according to where on the “drum” surface it is touching.

JS and MS, as they’re identified in court documents, are suing the state after a Schaumburg school district barred their 11-year-old daughter from using a medical cannabis patch and cannabis oil drops to regulate seizures resulting from chemotherapy treatment for leukemia, reports USA Today. Though medical marijuana was legalized in the state in 2014, consumption or possession on public school property remains outlawed. In a lawsuit filed Wednesday, the couple argue the statute not only makes it hard for their daughter to attend school—putting them at risk of violating a state law requiring that kids attend—but also violates her right to due process, reports the Chicago Tribune. School superintendent Andrew DuRoss says he reached out to the Illinois State Board of Education after the family requested that school officials administer the girl\\'s medication as needed. The request wasn\\'t unusual—school officials administer drugs to others, DuRoss notes—but the board made clear that possessing or using medical marijuana on school premises would violate state law. District officials \"share the same concerns and care about [the student] and her family in this situation … but we cannot legally grant the request,\" DuRoss says. The family\\'s lawyer has asked a judge to allow the use of medical marijuana in this case, until the state law can be revisited. (A 15-year-old with cerebral palsy helped change a similar law in Colorado, per USA Today.) A hearing is scheduled for 11am CST Friday, per CBS Chicago.',\n",

Variety reports that Millie Bobby Brown, who plays Eleven in the Netflix series Stranger Things, has either deactivated or deleted her @milliebbrown Twitter account, and it may be linked to a proliferation of memes painting the 14-year-old actress as being anti-gay (the BBC notes it\\'s not clear the trolling was the cause of the account vanishing). Twitter users have been taking advantage of meme generators to take selfies and other pictures of Brown and include homophobic slurs alongside them, making it appear as if she\\'s anti-gay. The Wrap notes that a #TakeDownMillieBobbyBrown hashtag also started making the rounds late last year and came back in full force at the beginning of June, which is Pride Month. But there are some who say the memes started as an inside joke within the LGBT community. \"The joke here seems to be that it\\'s so wildly out of character and unbelievable for Millie Bobby Brown to act violently or intolerantly, that presenting her as such makes people laugh,\" Vulture notes. In reality, Brown has been a vocal advocate for gay rights (she wore an LGBT pin to the 2017 MTV Movie and TV Awards) and also has stood up against cyberbullying via her @milliestopshate handle.

              " \"A suit, shirt, and tie can make even the fittest man look boxy and shapeless. A few easy tricks can show off your physique in the office without resorting to a pricey tailored suit:  Remove your jacket and hang it on the back of your chair. That's one less bulky garment between your build and your coworkers' eyes. Long day at the office? Roll up the sleeves of your button down shirt to show off a bit while you get work done. Men's' jeans and slacks of come in different cuts and styles. Find a pair that is your size but will show everyone your muscular thighs. Ditch the straight leg and relaxed fits for a boot cut or tapered leg. When you go out with friends or on a date, it's best to strike a balance between comfort and a fit snug enough to get attention. Avoid clothes that are so tight they look painted on. Not only are they less comfortable, but it could also look like you're trying too hard to get noticed.  Wear a tee shirt that's a size lower than what you usually wear. If you're a large, go for a medium. V-neck tees are also a good way to show off your chest definition. Tank tops are a good way to put your arms, shoulders, and chest on display. Even in colder weather, wear a tank top under an open button-down shirt to show off a little chest definition. If you've really been hitting leg days hard, show off with a short bathing suit at the beach. Board shorts are popular but don't show off anything above the knee. Try some shorter, square cut trunks instead. Does cold weather gear make you feel bulky in the worst way? Keep the heavy winter coat around for the dead of winter, but in cool autumn weather just layer your upper body with some long sleeve tees or thermals. You may have the muscles, but other features can distract from your bulk if left unchecked. Make other features complement, not compete. Do your best to keep your image clean cut.  Intensify your level of hygiene, especially if you work out all the time. Shower every day and shave as often as you need to. Some scruff is okay, but keep beards neat and trimmed. Unkempt facial hair will draw attention away from your build. Get a haircut. Hairstyles come and go, but short or trimmed hair is usually a look more associated with athletic guys. Get some new eyewear. Instead of staring at your guns, people might be starting at your thick Coke bottle glasses. Contact lenses or Lasik eye surgery are options if you're tired of glasses. A well-placed tattoo on a bicep or shoulder is a feature that will help draw eyes toward your arms. Body language speaks volumes. Don't shrink your body by slouching. Stand up straight and pull your shoulders back. Look people in the eye when you talk to them. When combined, these small actions let others know that you are someone worth noticing!\",\n",

Bookmakers have pledged to refund all bets placed on who would light the Olympic cauldron after some of Britain\\'s greatest Olympians teamed up with young athletes for the honour. No one could have predicted the surprise move and the only fair solution was to refund more than £50,000 of bets placed over the last seven years, William Hill said. Other bookmakers, including Sky Bet, also voided all bets, saying it was \\'impossible to back the correct flame lighter\\'. Surprise: In an unexpected move a group of seven young athletes lit the Olympic Cauldron during the London Olympic Games 2012 Opening Ceremony. Honour: The seven stars of the future were nominated to carry out the honour by a host of former Olympic greats. Handover: Sir Steve Redgrave was given the honour of carrying the torch into the stadium where he then handed it over to the up and coming athletes. The cauldron lighter had been a source of controversy in the lead up to last night\\'s opening ceremony with Olympic legends Sir Steve Redgrave, Daley Thompson and Roger Bannister all hotly tipped to be given the honour. It even led to a war of words between former decathlete Thompson and rower Redgrave as they seemingly went head to head to light the cauldron, as they both questioned the other\\'s credentials to be the one to light the. fire to launch London 2012. Redgrave did run into the stadium holding the Torch last night but he was greeted by seven young athletes, each nominated by himself and British Olympic heroes Lynn Davies, Duncan Goodhew, Dame Kelly Holmes, Dame Mary Peters, Shirley Robertson and Daley Thompson. It was the young athletes who each lit one of the copper petals which had been brought into the stadium with the teams and then rose to form the cauldron. Lighting up the games: Having lit the copper petals the cauldron came together in spectacular fashion. People gather around the Olympic Flame after the cauldron in the Olympic Stadium is lit. The decision has received some criticism across the globe however, as John Cherwa from the LA Times wrote: \\'Hated the flame lighting. Just make a decision and pick someone.\\' Australian journalist Karen Tighe, the Perth-based ABC Sports presenter, told BBC Radio 5Live: \\'I really loved the inspiration of a new generation, but it kind of felt a bit of an anti-climax at that point.\\' The teenagers, who have all shown promise. in their disciplines, ran around the track together after being passed. the flame. Callum. Airlie, 17, was nominated by gold medal-winning sailor Shirley. Robertson. He has been sailing since the age of four, and is a two-time. Optimist UK national champion who aims to be entered into the 2013 ISAF. (International Sailing Association & Federation) Open. Jordan. Duckitt, 18, was chairman of the London 2012 Young Ambassador Steering. Group for two years, and was nominated by Duncan Goodhew. War of words: Daley Thompson (left) said that rower Sir Steve Redgrave (right) was. \\'not in the same class\\' as his friend Sebastian Coe, but neither ended up lighting the cauldron after weeks of debate. Athletics talent Desiree Henry was put forward by Daley Thomson after the. 16-year-old was the youngest member of the Great Britain youth team to. gain a world 200m title at the IAAF World Youth Championships in 2011. Runner. Katie Kirk, 18, who was selected to run in the 400m at the Commonwealth. Games in Delhi, India, was nominated by Dame Mary Peters, who won gold. in the women`s Pentathlon at the 1972 Munich games, while Sir Steve. nominated young rower Cameron MacRitchie, 19. The. teenager finished fifth with his partner James Edwards in the men`s. pair at the 2012 GB rowing team under 23 trials in April. Aidan Reynolds, 18, was put forward by Lynn Davies, who captained Team GB at Moscow 1980 and Los Angeles 1984 and Adelle Tracey was nominated by double gold medalist Dame Kelly Holmes. Tipped: Sir Roger Bannister had been widely tipped to lit the cauldron. Aidan. gave up a promising basketball career to focus on the javelin, winning. three medals at national level at the English Schools, UK School Games. and English Championships while Adelle won 800m silver for Great Britain in the European Youth Olympic Festival in Finland. Despite the surprise cauldron lighting Sir Steve. Redgrave, said today that he was \"very emotional\" when he carried the. Torch into the Olympic Stadium. The five-times Olympic rowing champion told BBC. Breakfast: \\'It was very special. I must admit I probably knew about 10. days before. I\\'m looking forward now to not being asked questions such. as \\'Are you lighting the torch, or the cauldron?\\' \\'I suppose the questions now will be \\'Are you putting out the cauldron?\\' - I\\'ve not had that phone call yet.\\' He said that when he entered the stadium there was an \\'absolutely amazing atmosphere\\'. He. added: \\'There was a line-up of construction workers on the site, suited. and booted, it was very emotional for them and for me.\\' Sir Steve,. who was at Eton Dorney today, where the rowing will take place, revealed. that he saw very little of the opening ceremony. \\'I saw the first. five minutes of the actual opening, then I was taken away for the. filming, I got into my pyjama suit, I\\'ve still got the shoes on now. Speaking after the decision to refund all bets Graham Sharpe, of William Hill, said: \\'What happened, no-one could have predicted. It was not put to us, nobody quoted it. \\'The only fair thing to do was to refund all the bets from over the last seven years.\\' He added: \\'Sir Steve Redgrave was an early favourite. \\'It\\'s like a horse coming along the final leg, then along comes another horse and the jockey jumps off and gets on the other one. \\'We\\'ve got to hold our hands up. \\'Everyone has had a lot of fun, but there was no declared winner. \\'Let\\'s move on and start backing the next one.\\' It had been a \\'lively market\\' with lots of relatively small £5, £10 and £20 bets, he added, with the biggest stake placed being £100. More than £50,000 was placed at William Hill on athletes including Sir Steve and Sir Roger Bannister, the first man to break the four-minute mile.

U.S. Olympic Committee CEO Scott Blackmun said Frazier was \"one of the greatest boxers of all time\" and \"was an Olympic champion and an American icon.\" \\n  \\n Frazier used his devastating left hook with impunity during his professional career, retiring in 1976 with a 32-4-1 record and staging one last comeback fight in 1981. \\n  \\n HBO analyst and famed trainer Emanuel Steward, who knew Frazier from amateur boxing, told boxer Buster Mathis not to fight Frazier as a pro. \\n  \\n \"And in 1968, they did, and Joe Frazier\\'s determination and strength and pressure -- and that wicked left hook -- he broke Buster down and knocked him out,\" Steward said. \"He was one of the most vicious machines I ever saw in my life. \\n  \\n But it was his three much-hyped fights against Ali that helped seal his legend. \\n  \\n Frazier bested Ali at 1971\\'s \"Fight of the Century\" at Madison Square Garden. In the 15th round, Frazier landed perhaps the most famous left hook in history, catching Ali on the jaw and dropping the former champ for a four-count, according to Frazier\\'s bio at the International Boxing Hall of Fame. Frazier left the ring as the undisputed champ and handed Ali his first professional loss. \\n  \\n \"Ali was talking to him and Joe never did bow down. Ali would make a comment and Joe would talk right back. He always had that determination,\" Steward said. \\n  \\n Ali won a 12-round decision in a January 1974 rematch, setting the stage for the classic \"Thrilla in Manila\" just outside the Philippine capital in 1975. \\n  \\n Ali took the early rounds, but Frazier rebounded before losing the last five rounds. By the end of the 14th, Frazier\\'s eyes were nearly swollen shut, and his corner stopped the bout, according to the biography. \\n  \\n Later, Ali said, \"It was the closest I\\'ve come to death.\" \\n  \\n Philadelphia Daily News columnist Stan Hochman noted that Frazier \"summoned the skill and courage to battle Ali into the 14th round in Manila.\" \\n  \\n \"He was a fighter, pure and simple, with a style that seemed destined for a short career. Trudge forward, lean on the other guy, take two to land one,\" Hochman wrote. \\n  \\n \"\\'You\\'ve gotta breathe on him,\\'\" Frazier would say, in a rare attempt to define his style. \\'No shortcuts\\' was his mantra. There\\'s a lesson there for all of us,\" Hochman\\'s column said Tuesday. \\n  \\n Boxer Mike Tyson sent Twitter messages saying the era of Frazier and Ali represented an age of \"competitive fighting at the highest level.\" \\n  \\n \"Each man would not give an inch until they were dead,\" he said, adding that \"it has always been an honor to be compared\" to Frazier. \\n  \\n Frazier, a two-time heavyweight champion for nearly three years until he lost in January 1973 to George Foreman, ran a well-known boxing gym in Philadelphia for years. \\n  \\n \"I don\\'t mind working with the kids,\" Frazier told CNN\\'s Don Lemon in 2009. \"The kids is tomorrow. And if we don\\'t do what we\\'re supposed to do for them now, how are you going (to) expect them to carry on?\" \\n  \\n Asked whether he was similar to Rocky Balboa, Frazier replied, \"Sure. I worked at the slaughterhouse. I\\'m the guy that ran in the streets of Philadelphia.\" \\n  \\n Nutter said Frazier \"represented the heart and soul of boxing in our great city.\" \\n  \\n \"In the ring and in the neighborhoods, he carried himself with dignity and courage.

And, some note, that hostility is making it harder to recruit more black officers. Meanwhile, in Missouri, protests continue over the shooting death Tuesday of Antonio Martin, whom police say was armed.

              " \"By. Martin Robinson. PUBLISHED:. 08:58 EST, 17 September 2013. |. UPDATED:. 10:41 EST, 18 September 2013. A health and safety expert knocked a teenage girl off her moped before speeding off, leaving her in the road to be run over and killed by an oncoming minibus, a court heard today. Jade Clark's scooter was 'swallowed up and fragmented into hundreds of pieces' by Brian Hampton's Volvo 4X4 after he ploughed into the back of it. The executive swerved around the 16-year-old after she was flung into a Hampshire dual carriageway, before she was hit by a Volkswagen minibus whose driver had no time to react. Hampton, 58, an engineer who checks the safety of signals on Britain's railways, fled the scene and then tried to cover up his part in the teenager's death, the prosecution say. Road death: Jade Clark. 16, was killed after Brian Hampton, sketched in court, hit her with his 4X4 before she was run over and killed by a minibus, a court heard. Debris: The shattered remains of Jade's moped after a crash the prosecution say was caused by Hampton who then fled. Bournemouth Crown Court heard Hampton, who was already banned from driving, told his wife, his employers, a car garage and the police his £40,000 Volvo had struck a deer. Hampton paid £4,300 for the damage to the front of his vehicle to be hastily repaired, a jury was told. The court heard Hampton struck Jade's scooter as he drove along the A31 in Ringwood, Hampshire, on February 24. Crash scene: Police investigators look at the duel carriageway near Ringwood, Hampshire, after a smash that claimed the like of 16-year-old Jade. Chain of events: Jade was knocked into the road and died instantly from severe head injuries when a minibus followed. Simon Jones, prosecuting, said: 'Jade fell into the middle of the carriageway and the defendant swerved around her. That left her exposed to the fast moving traffic. 'Her moped was swallowed up and pushed along the carriageway.' Mr Jones said motorist John Ward was driving a VW minibus and had no time to react before hitting Jade, a trainee hairdresser from Ringwood in the New Forest. He added: 'He drove over what he initially believed to be debris and caused catastrophic head injuries and instant death. 'The moped was fragmented into hundreds of pieces. 'Brian Hampton had already driven off effectively leaving Jade and the scene of a fatal road collision. 'It was his duty to stop. 'What the defendant did was to seek to evade justice and pervert the course of justice by arranging for the damage to his vehicle to be subsequently repaired. 'He did this with one purpose in mind - that being to ensure there could be no link between him, his vehicle and the collision that occurred on the A31 that day.' Case: Brian Hampton is on trial for perverting the course of justice after allegedly lying to cover up his part in the crash. Hampton drove his damaged vehicle to the Premier Inn in Poole where he had been booked in by his employers, railway company Signalling Solutions, the court heard. He emailed his manager at 4am the following day saying he couldn't attend work because he had swollen feet. He then told his wife Maureen that his car had broken down and he had to wait several days for a recovery truck to tow it back to his home in Kent, it is alleged. But later that day he secretly drove to Ashford near his home town of Shadoxhurst where he took his car to a garage then stayed in a nearby Holiday Inn for two nights, the jury heard. Hampton is said to have told the body shop he had hit a deer, then spent £4,300 getting the Volvo fixed. Tributes: The flowers left for Jade Clark at Ringwood Fire station, close to the scene of the crash. Terrible: Trainee hairdresser jade was sent flying into the middle of the dual carriageway, where she was killed. Grief: Jade Clark's mother Sharon Clark is comforted by her husband Daniel Clark during a press conference at the time of her death. Mechanics replaced the car's bonnet, grill, radiator, sump shield, bumper and number plate but raised concerns because there had been no blood or fur on the car. When officers swooped on his home on March 21, Hampton told them he had no idea why he was being arrested. He told police that on the night Jade died he had been visiting his daughter in Poole but had arrived too late so had bought fish and chips then booked into a hotel. He said no incidents had taken place and he had not had any repair work done to his car. In a second interview he conceded the car had been repaired but said he had no clue as to how the damage had occurred. Mr Jones said a series of CCTV images of Hampton's car prior to the incident showed the grill trim in tact, while photos taken after showed it damaged. Incident: Hampton drove a Silver Volvo XC 90 like this one, and then paid £4,300 to get it repaired, jury hears. Hampton was also caught on camera checking the front of his vehicle at the Premier Inn in Poole, and told staff when he left that he couldn't get the bonnet open. Mr Jones said: 'There can be no other credible explanation for the repair other than for this defendant to distance himself from the collision and subsequent detection of his involvement.' Hampton previously pleaded guilty to separate charges of causing death by careless driving, driving while disqualified and without insurance on February 24 and 25, the jury was told. He denies the charge of perverting the course of justice by arranging for the repair of the collision damage, failing to stop at the scene of an accident and failing to report an accident. The trial at Bournemouth Crown Court continues. Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.\",\n",

              " '— A faltering diplomatic effort to persuade Iran to curtail its nuclear program was salvaged Thursday by an agreement to hold further talks next month in Moscow, concluding two days of negotiations that exposed the difficulty of bridging the chasm between Tehran’s ambitions and the West’s demands. \\n  \\n Addressing reporters at the close of the marathon talks, European Union foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton acknowledged that “significant differences” remain over how to address international concerns about Iran’s nuclear activities. However, she said there was “some common ground” and took heart that Iran had agreed to further talks. \\n  \\n “What we have now is some common ground and a meeting in place where we can take this forward,” she said. \\n  \\n The talks in Baghdad — between Iran and world powers United States, Russia, China, Britain, France and Germany — had been accompanied by high hopes that the current climate was conducive to progress on a deal that would help ease a decade of tensions over Iran’s nuclear activities and lift the threat of war hanging over the Middle East. \\n  \\n But the negotiations snagged early on as Iran rejected a package of proposals put forward by the world powers as inadequate because it offered no immediate relief from crippling economic sanctions, nor any acknowledgment of the right Tehran claims to enrich uranium. \\n  \\n Chief Iranian negotiator Saeed Jalili called the talks “thorough but unfinished.” He said Iran was not prepared to make any concessions unless the six nations accept “the undeniable right of the Iranian nation . . . to enrich uranium.” U.S. officials said that is not a concession they are prepared to grant. \\n  \\n Jalili also made it clear that Iran would not countenance a deal that did not alleviate the sanctions that have been taking an increasingly devastating toll on the country’s economy. \\n  \\n “We believe the pathway to talks can be successful only if destructive pathways working in parallel with the pathways are stopped,” Jalili said. “This strategy of pressure is over. It is outmoded.” \\n  \\n Iran did concede, however, that it is open to negotiations about the level to which it will continue to enrich uranium. Iran has the capacity to enrich uranium up to 20 percent, which puts it within technical reach of the 90 percent level required for the fissile material used in nuclear weapons. \\n  \\n If world powers acknowledged Iran’s right, Jalili said, “this enrichment . . . could be an issue of cooperation and talks.” \\n  \\n Ashton said the six world powers had put forward proposals concerning “what could be done around the 20 percent” enrichment level, suggesting that the issue could be addressed further at the Moscow talks, scheduled for June 18-19. \\n  \\n ‘A lot of work still to do’ \\n  \\n In Washington, administration officials acknowledged that the talks had not produced anything close to the breakthrough some had hoped for. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton said that the negotiations had been “serious” and “substantive” but that significant gaps remained. \\n  \\n “We think that the choice is now Iran’s to work to close the gaps,” Clinton told reporters at the State Department. “We anticipate there will be ongoing work between now and the next meeting in Moscow, but it’s very clear that there’s a lot of work still to do.” \\n  \\n The bright spot of the two days of talks, she said, was the unity of the six powers in dealing with Iran. In contrast with previous such efforts, the six nations were “speaking literally off the same page and with the same voice” in Baghdad, she said. \\n  \\n Much of Thursday was spent haggling over the venue for the next round of talks. The six-nation bloc insisted on Geneva, but Iran refused to join in negotiations in any country that had supported sanctions against the Islamic republic. \\n  \\n The mood seemed to lift somewhat during the day, and a U.S. official said that after one of the group sessions, Jalili paused to chat with the chief U.S. negotiator, Wendy Sherman, marking a rare direct encounter between representatives of two nations estranged for more than three decades. \\n  \\n The effort was aided in part by a dust storm that enveloped Baghdad, forced the closure of the airport and prevented delegates from departing, stretching what had been intended as a two- hour morning session well into the evening. \\n  \\n The delegates were also driven, U.S. officials said, by a sense of urgency to keep diplomacy alive at a time when Israeli threats to bomb Iranian nuclear facilities have raised fears that war could be imminent. \\n  \\n “There is nobody . . . that does not understand the enormous pressures and the enormous stakes,” said a senior U.S. administration official, speaking on the condition of anonymity. “We are urgent about it because every day we don’t figure this out is a day they are going with their nuclear program.” \\n  \\n Intractability vs. flexibility \\n  \\n The chasm between the six powers and the Iranians on such core issues as sanctions and uranium enrichment deepened pessimism about the likelihood of a deal. \\n  \\n “The West can’t give enough on sanctions, and Iran won’t concede enough on the nuclear side — at least not yet,” said Aaron David Miller, a former senior adviser to the State Department on Middle East issues. In the meantime, he said, the talks are being kept alive as a “management exercise driven by Iran’s vulnerability and need for sanctions relief and the West’s fear of war.” \\n  \\n But others drew hope from both sides’ willingness to continue talking. \\n  \\n “An initial confidence-building deal is still within reach if both sides show some flexibility,” said Daryl G. Kimball, executive director of the Arms Control Association, a Washington nonprofit organization. \\n  \\n “While an agreement on initial confidence-building steps was not reached in Baghdad, it is clear that both sides are exchanging serious proposals that could produce results in the next round.” \\n  \\n Warrick reported from Washington. ||||| “What we have now is some common ground, and a meeting in place where we can take that further forward,” said Catherine Ashton, the European Union’s top foreign policy official and the lead negotiator for the six powers: the United States, Russia, China, Britain, France and Germany. Still, she told reporters at the news conference in Baghdad, “significant differences remain” after what she called two days of “very intense and detailed discussions,” and she emphasized that time was short. \\n  \\n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \\n  \\n The chief Iranian negotiator, Saeed Jalili, the secretary of Iran’s National Security Council and the personal representative of Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran’s supreme leader, described the talks as positive. But he suggested in his remarks to reporters that the main obstacle was the other side’s refusal to accept Iran’s claimed right to enrich its own nuclear fuel, which it has continued to do despite four Security Council resolutions demanding a suspension. \\n  \\n “This is our right, and it is clearly irrefutable,” Mr. Jalili said. If the six powers accept such a right, he said, “we will, of course, welcome some offer to cooperate on.” \\n  \\n The six counter that the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty has no explicit “right to enrich,” only the right to a civilian nuclear program under strict supervision by the International Atomic Energy Agency, and that Iran has been out of compliance. \\n  \\n Part of Iran’s proposal, never put into writing, centered on the demand that the global powers recognize its right to enrich, “something we are obviously not willing to do,” a senior American official said after the talks. \\n  \\n The proposal of the six centered on getting Iran to suspend enrichment to 20 percent, to export its current and continuing stock of 20 percent enriched uranium and to open up its once-secret Fordo enrichment plant to international inspection. But Iran did not consider the benefits offered for doing so to be sufficient. \\n  \\n Photo \\n  \\n There had been hopes in Washington, Israel and Saudi Arabia that these talks would produce at least a suspension of that enrichment, but the American official and European negotiators said that they did not expect to get a suspension at the Baghdad talks. Still, the failure to do much more than agree to another set of talks is likely to be criticized by Republicans and by pro-Israeli lobbying groups and legislators in the United States. \\n  \\n The goal of the six powers — that Iran suspend all uranium enrichment as the Security Council has demanded — remained the same at the Baghdad talks. Five of the six are the permanent members of the Security Council. \\n  \\n A senior American official said the six had never expected to reach an agreement with Iran at this stage and that the measures coming into force on July 1, notably a European embargo on Iranian oil, would “increase the leverage on this negotiation as we move forward. Maximum pressure is not yet being felt by Iran.” \\n  \\n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \\n  \\n During the Baghdad talks, the six powers exchanged detailed proposals with the Iranian side, which presented what Iranian news reports described as a five-point plan containing both nuclear and nonnuclear elements, including nuclear safety and cooperation, regional issues, and the “right to enrich.” Mr. Jalili said the proposal included cooperation battling drug traffickers and Somali piracy off the Horn of Africa. \\n  \\n But much of the conversation dealt with the issue of highly enriched uranium, considered the most important issue, because it brings Iran closer to being able to construct a nuclear weapon if it wishes. This Iran denies intending to do, citing Ayatollah Khamenei’s statement that nuclear weapons are “haram,” or forbidden by Islam. Iran says it is stockpiling 20 percent enriched uranium for use in medical reactors and has disputed Western assertions that the supply far exceeds what the Iranians need. \\n  \\n Whatever expectations there may have been for substantive progress in Baghdad faded as the second day of discussions began, when Iran’s state-financed Press TV satellite broadcaster reported the prospects for success were “vague and under question” if the powers rejected the Iranian plan. \\n  \\n Several accounts in Iran’s state-controlled media compared the positions taken by Tehran’s interlocutors in Baghdad to those of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, which considers Iran’s nuclear program an existential threat. \\n  \\n In return for early Iranian steps to freeze 20 percent, the six offered benefits like spare parts for civilian aircraft, help with nuclear safety at civilian installations, and perhaps a pledge that Iran has the right to a peaceful nuclear program so long as it resolves doubts about its intentions through serious, detailed, technical negotiations with the six and through openness with the inspectors of the International Atomic Energy Agency. \\n  \\n The six also offered a new version of a fuel-exchange program, to take Iran’s 20 percent enriched uranium and return it as processed fuel for medical reactors. \\n  \\n Iran experts said it was premature to judge the outcome of the Baghdad round. \\n  \\n Trita Parsi, president of the National Iranian American Council in Washington, a strong proponent of negotiations, said it was not surprising that both sides went into the talks with hard bargaining positions. But, he said, “I think the Iranians are going to have to accept that the full scope of sanctions they want lifted are not going to be done. At the same time, I have a hard time believing this will be kept alive, with significant steps by Iran and no reciprocal concessions by the six powers.” \\n  \\n Aaron Miller, a former senior State Department official, called the talks “a management exercise driven by Iran’s vulnerability and need for sanctions relief and the West’s fear of war.” He said that it would be hard nonetheless to find a sustainable deal. “The West can’t give enough on sanctions and Iran won’t concede enough on the nuclear side,” he said. |||||',\n",

In the context of Lent, emphasize that Jesus was born and lived on Earth for one purpose — to show everyone how to achieve salvation and everlasting life.  Note that he accepted and embraced this calling, despite his own suffering, because of the eternal glory that it would make available to all of us. You do not need to dwell on the gruesome details of crucifixion, which can upset and frighten younger children, but you should introduce Jesus’ death. Emphasize the reasons for Jesus’ sacrifice, that he gave up his earthly life so that believers could have eternal salvation.  For preschoolers, stick to saying that Jesus died and rose from the dead for us. For younger school kids, add in some more details about the death and resurrection.  Note that it shows that death is not the end, but rather the beginning of eternal life. Younger teens and beyond can better handle the details of crucifixion and comprehend the symbolism of death and rebirth vis-a-vis mankind’s salvation. Teach your child that Easter is the most important Christian holiday — yes, more important than Christmas — and far more than just bunnies, eggs, and chocolate. Easter Sunday celebrates Jesus’ return from the dead. The concepts of resurrection and life after death are fundamental to the Christian faith, so introduce them early.  Tell younger kids that all the celebrating that surrounds Easter should remind us of the joy of knowing how much Jesus loves us, and that he showed us the path to eternal life.

              " 'An investigation into an attack that killed eight U.S. troops in eastern Afghanistan last year said the combat outpost was an \"attractive target\" because protection improvements hadn\\'t been made and intelligence assets had been diverted. These were main points in the findings released Friday by the U.S. military into the probe of the October 3 attack on Combat Outpost Keating in the Kamdesh district of Nuristan province. The attack killed eight U.S. service members and wounded 22 others. Based on the recommendations in the investigation, Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal, the top coalition military commander in Afghanistan, \"took appropriate action regarding Army personnel involved.\" The report also praised soldiers of B Troop, 3rd Squadron, 61st Calvary for repelling the assault by a force of 300 militants. Commanders must regularly assess \"the value and vulnerabilities\" of combat outposts, said the report, which \"made several recommendations to improve coalition tactics.\" The base had been scheduled to be closed before the attack occurred, and \"needed force protection improvements (which) were not made\" because of the imminent closure. \"Critical intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance assets which had been supporting COP Keating had been diverted to assist ongoing intense combat operations in other areas,\" the report said. It also said \"intelligence assessments had become desensitized to reports of massing enemy formations by previous reports that had proved false.\" All of these factors \"resulted in an attractive target for enemy fighters.\" The military says militants had been planning the attack for days, hiding mortars, rockets and heavy machine guns in the mountains. The assault started around dawn as bullets and rockets peppered the remote outpost October 3 and lasted for 12 hours, pinning down the exhausted troops. One soldier said afterward the insurgency was so fierce that the troops couldn\\'t get to their weapons to fire back. They called in air support to help thwart the militants. \"They were under heavy enemy contact,\" Sgt. Jayson Souter said. Four servicemen -- Souter, a fellow soldier, an Apache helicopter pilot and a gunner -- talked to a military reporter about their roles during the Keating attack in an interview posted by the Department of Defense on Facebook and NATO\\'s International Security Assistance Force YouTube Channel. Chief Warrant Officer Ross Lewallen, an Apache pilot, said a few aircraft were damaged in what was a \"time-consuming endeavor\" governed by tough terrain. He said the morning battle was \"significant,\" but later troops were able to identify targets and eliminate larger weapons. \"One of the primary reasons for the fight taking so long is that it is an extreme terrain,\" he said in the interview. The report said the troops killed 150 enemy fighters and \"found that the soldiers and junior leaders fought heroically in repelling an enemy force five times their size. \"Members of B Troop upheld the highest standards of warrior ethics and professionalism and distinguished themselves with conspicuous gallantry, courage, and bravery under the heavy enemy fire that surrounded them.\"',\n",

Dr Daniela Kostadinova, head of the hospital where the victim was taken in critical condition, said on Wednesday morning, in the northern village of Sitovo, a 40-year-old unemployed man doused himself with petrol and tried to commit suicide. The doctor told Bulgarian National radio the man could no longer afford to even buy bread for his one child and that he 'could not stand it anymore.'

Ordinary people find it hard to make ends meet, struggling to share their tiny salary for food, utility bills and other expenses. Many have accused public officials of corruption. The dire economic situation plus the country’s status within the European Union has led many to predict that many will head to the UK when travel restrictions end next year.

But Armstrong\\'s attorney, Tim Herman, sees it differently. He compared the situation to other sports figures who were suspended for various infractions but did not have to give back their paychecks. \\n  \\n \"My only point is no athlete ever, to my understanding, has ever gone back and paid back his compensation,\" Herman said. \"Not (New Orleans Saints coach) Sean Payton or anybody else. They were suspended, but nobody said you\\'ve got to give your paycheck back.\" \\n  \\n In an interview with USA TODAY Sports, Herman shared his thoughts on various issues stemming from Armstrong\\'s confession that he used banned drugs and blood transfusions to boost himself as a cyclist. Armstrong\\'s admission came after years of false denials and lawsuits against those who dared to challenge him about it, including SCA Promotions, the company that paid the Tour bonuses. \\n  \\n LANCE\\'S CONFESSION: His story was \\'one big lie\\' \\n  \\n Some of the issues Herman addressed are: \\n  \\n Armstrong\\'s athletic eligibility: Herman said Armstrong does not expect to compete again in sanctioned sports after being banned for life because of doping. But he still plans to cooperate with anti-doping officials even if there is no reward for him in terms of restored eligibility. \\n  \\n \"He doesn\\'t expect it (eligibility), and his offer (to cooperate) is not contingent on that,\" Herman said. \\n  \\n To get his ban reduced, Armstrong would be required to provide a full confession under oath and further assistance to help clean up the sport of cycling. If he meets that burden, his ban could be reduced to \"no less than eight years,\" according to the World Anti-Doping Agency code. Armstrong, 41, would be near 50 by the time an eight-year ban expires. \\n  \\n \"I read the rule like you do,\" Herman said. \"An eight-year ban, that would be a lifetime ban (for Armstrong).\" \\n  \\n Doping in 2009-10: Herman said Armstrong did not dope during his comeback years of 2009 and 2010, and he disputes blood evidence that indicates otherwise. U.S. Anti-Doping Agency chief Travis Tygart disagrees. He told 60 Minutes that the odds are one-to-a-million that the blood test results from those years are because of something other than doping. \\n  \\n \"It\\'s my understanding that training at altitude or living at altitude, which he was doing at the time, that\\'s a variable that is unaccounted for in their analyses,\" Herman said. \"It\\'s certainly not one in a million.\" \\n  \\n In his televised confession to Oprah Winfrey, Armstrong said he stopped doping after winning his seventh and last Tour de France in 2005. \\n  \\n The doping culture: Herman stressed that Armstrong was a product of the doping culture in cycling and not the intimidating doping \"boss\" portrayed by USADA and others. \\n  \\n \"It\\'s a European culture that all these Americans were dropped into,\" Herman said. \"It\\'s been going on for a hundred years. To hear Tygart tell it, Lance Armstrong is responsible for the culture he was dropped into on a team (that) was engaged in misconduct long before he got to the team.\" \\n  \\n Herman said Armstrong had little choice. \\n  \\n \"He would do what\\'s asked of him to contribute and be part of the solution,\" he said of Armstrong. \"He was a 19-year-old kid dropped in this culture, just like everybody else.

He\\'s acknowledged his mistake, but he\\'s like virtually every other rider who was a competitor of any significance.\" \\n  \\n PHOTOS: ARMSTRONG THROUGH THE YEARS \\n  \\n Mistrust and cooperation: Herman said mistrust has gotten in the way of Armstrong cooperating with USADA and Tygart, his longtime nemesis. During his appearance on 60 Minutes, Tygart accused Armstrong of lying to Winfrey about several issues. \\n  \\n \"That isn\\'t all that conducive to a feeling of mutual trust,\" Herman said. \\n  \\n RELATED: Will Lance cooperate with USADA? \\n  \\n He also said USADA \"doesn\\'t have jurisdiction\" to clean up cycling because cycling is a mostly European sport. Armstrong instead hopes to cooperate with other anti-doping officials, perhaps from the World Anti-Doping Agency. But that might not happen any time soon because of disputes involving WADA and the International Cycling Union (UCI). \\n  \\n \"Whether it\\'s a Truth and Reconciliation Commission or some comprehensive attempt to clean things up, it doesn\\'t make any difference as long as something like that is convened,\" Herman said. \"Lance will definitely cooperate.\" \\n  \\n Not repaying the bonuses: Herman makes a legal argument when explaining why Armstrong should not repay the Tour de France bonuses even though he was stripped of all seven of his Tour titles. He said it\\'s a contractual matter between Armstrong and his cycling team\\'s owner, Tailwind Sports. \\n  \\n Tailwind had the performance bonuses insured by SCA Promotions, which withheld payment in 2004 because of suspicions that Armstrong cheated to win them. In response, Armstrong and Tailwind sued SCA for payment, leading to litigation in which Armstrong denied under oath that he took performance-enhancing drugs. \\n  \\n SCA relented and paid Armstrong a settlement, but now it wants a refund, especially after watching Armstrong tell Winfrey that he indeed engaged in doping every time he won the Tour. SCA attorney Jeff Tillotson said the company is owed about $12.5 million including legal costs for Tour bonuses in 2002, 2003 and 2004. \\n  \\n \"I thought he was remorseful,\" Tillotson said Monday. \"Doesn\\'t sound like it to me… Does he seriously think he can escape liability by maintaining this fiction?\" \\n  \\n Herman previously noted the settlement terms say the case cannot be reopened. He also said Tailwind was obligated to pay Armstrong the bonuses whether SCA covered the cost or not. \\n  \\n \"The bottom line is that Tailwind bought the (insurance) policy (from SCA),\" Herman said. \"Tailwind paid the premium. Tailwind made the claim, and the money (from SCA) was paid to Tailwind, not Lance Armstrong. I\\'m sure people will characterize that as a loophole, but it\\'s a pretty significant factor.\" \\n  \\n MORE: Readers sue Armstrong over lies in books \\n  \\n What\\'s next? Herman said Armstrong plans to make a \"positive impact\" in much the same way he has with Livestrong, the charity he founded to support cancer survivors. \\n  \\n \"He\\'s going to continue to do what he can to continue to earn back the trust that he\\'s forgone with his conduct,\" Herman said. \"That\\'s an ongoing process.\" \\n  \\n Follow Brent Schrotenboer on Twitter @Schrotenboer ||||| Lance Armstrong, founder of the LIVESTRONG foundation, takes part in a special session regarding cancer in the developing world during the Clinton Global Initiative in New York September 22, 2010. \\n  \\n WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Disgraced cyclist Lance Armstrong\\'s public admission that he took performance-enhancing drugs will not change U.S. prosecutors\\' decision to spare him of criminal charges, an attorney who oversaw the federal investigation said on Tuesday. \\n  \\n The statement by André Birotte, the U.S. attorney based in Los Angeles, follows Armstrong\\'s confession in a televised interview last month. \\n  \\n \"We made a decision on that case a little over a year ago.

              " \"A lock can be manually disengaged by taking the knob apart, and even quality locks won’t stop you if the door is off its hinges. Doorknobs will require a screwdriver or paperclip; hinges will need a nail and a pounding tool, like a hammer or rock.  Borrow these items from a neighbor or snag them from your tool shed. If your car is open, you might have some emergency tools there, too. The kind of screwdriver you need will depend on the kind of door you have. Knobs and hinges are often fastened with Phillips head (cross slot) screws. Even if you don’t have a screwdriver available, you may be able to remove fasteners with a suitably thin, sturdy tool, like a butter knife or a bent pin. Ideally, you’ll be able to see mounting screws connecting the knob to the door. These can be simply unfastened with your screwdriver to take apart the knob. Pull the knob free of the door, and disengage the latch with your fingers.  Depending on the kind of lock installed in your door, you may be able to disengage the lock immediately after removing the knob, or you may need to remove a secondary mounting plate. Some knobs may only have a screw fastening the knob to the spindle that both knobs are attached to. To remove these, loosen the screw on the metal connecting the knob to the door. Some knobs may have a pin-size hole in the front of the knob instead of mounting screws. Insert a thin piece of metal, like a straightened paperclip, as deep into the hole as possible while twisting the knob and pushing on the door to open it. In some situations, you may find that fastening hardware for knobs, like screws and bolts, are only accessible from the inside. The hinges are usually the most vulnerable part of a door, requiring only a nail to bypass. Place a nail (or a similar item) at the bottom of the opening for a hinge pin. Then hit the nail with a tool (like a hammer or rock) to push the pin out. Do this for all hinges.  The hinge pins may be stiff when you remove them, even after they’ve been partially pushed out with a nail. For easier removal, use a screwdriver like a chisel under the rim of the pin head to pop it free. Much like knobs, doors that are well-installed may not have outside accessible hinge pins. You won’t be able to easily pop the door off its hinges if this is the case for you. Most sliding glass doors, opposed to traditional hinged doors, are not directly fastened to your home's structure. Many rest in a track and are locked in place, and by jumping the door out of the track, you can easily bypass it.  You may be able to jump a light sliding glass door by prying up and outward with a flathead screwdriver (or two), but a prybar or crowbar will work best. Be careful when trying to get your door to jump its track. If it falls, it could cause expensive damage. To make sliding doors in your home less vulnerable to break ins, you may want to secure your door with a security bar, like a wooden dowel.\",\n",

The finding is based on a University of Mauritius study of 100 kitchen towels used unwashed for one month, roughly half of which were found to have bacterial growth. Of these—typically towels associated with children, larger families, multiple uses, higher humidity, and diets containing meat—37% contained E. coli and the same percentage had Enterococcus, bacteria linked to infections of the gut, urinary tract, and bloodstream, reports US News & World Report. Another 14% contained Staphylococcus aureus, which, if it gets into food, can produce toxins triggering food poisoning, per Live Science. But staph being \"[on] the towel isn\\'t as concerning as [it being in] food,\" an expert tells Live Science, noting researchers failed to find the types of bacteria typically associated with foodborne illnesses, like salmonella and O157:H7, a particularly harmful strain of E. coli. \"What\\'s listed here doesn\\'t initially raise concerns with me,\" he says. Still, researchers say people should be careful when using towels in the kitchen. \"Bigger families with children and elderly members should be especially vigilant to hygiene,\" says Susheela Biranjia-Hurdoyal, lead author of the research presented at an annual meeting of the American Society for Microbiology, per USA Today.

              " \"By. Amanda Williams. The death of a British tourist in a Vietnamese hotel room remains a mystery after local doctors blamed alcohol consumption but a British pathologist insists he had not drunk enough to kill him. Student nurse Jake O’Grady, 26, was found in his hotel room while on a backpacking expedition in Vietnam at the end of last year. He had been travelling for just over a month with friends Katie Benefer and Ciara Desmond when he became unwell while celebrating the New Year in the city of Hanoi. Police later entered his room Hong Ngoc Hotel and found his body in bed after his friends raised the alarm. Student nurse Jake O'Grady, 26, was found dead in his hotel room while on a backpacking expedition in Vietnam at the end of last year. A post mortem examination was carried out by Vietnamese doctors who found Mr O’Grady had died on January 1 from acute respiratory failure as a result of alcohol abuse, adding that there was a slight blood clot to the left of his forehead, suggesting violent contact with a hard object. But Home Office pathologist Dr Alison Armour was unable to confirm the cause of his death and said that the 212 microgrammes of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood was not in the fatal range. The legal limit for driving is 80mg. No drugs were found and there was no suggestion of violence or suspicious circumstances surrounding his death. The details emerged at an inquest in Preston, held after Mr O’Grady’s body was flown back to the UK. In. a statement read to the court Dr Armour said: 'There is no evidence of natural disease to cause or accelerate. death. 212mg of alcohol per 100ml of blood would cause a moderate degree. of intoxication but is not within the fatal range which is nearly. 400mg. In my opinion it is insufficient to cause this man’s death. 'I can’t contribute this young man’s death to the abuse of alcohol. Death should be regarded as unascertained. He had been travelling for just over a month with friends Katie Benefer and Ciara Desmond when he became unwell while celebrating the New Year in the city of Hanoi. 'I. disagree with the cause of death from the post mortem in Vietnam. There. are no marks of violence to the body, no evidence to support the view. that he had been the victim of an assault.' The coroner heard Mr O’Grady, from Morecambe, Lancashire was an 'outgoing friendly guy who was loved by many people.' He and his friends had travelled from the UK on November 20 2013 to go back packing around the Far East. They had visited Thailand and Cambodia before arriving in Vietnam on December 19 and had checked into the hostel on December 29, 2013. But on December 31, the friends became separated after a night drinking in bars. The two girls left Mr O’Grady at around 3.30am at the Lighthouse Bar to go home but Miss Benefar had become concerned about his wellbeing after he failed to respond to her text messages. In a statement read from Det Insp Beverley Foster of Lancashire Constabulary, Miss Benefar confirmed that she was notified by police on New Year’s Day that her friend was dead. A post mortem examination was carried out by Vietnamese doctors who found Mr O'Grady had died on January 1 from acute respiratory failure as a result of alcohol abuse. Miss Benefar was asked to identify his body and she confirmed her friend looked 'peaceful'. Area. coroner Simon Jones recording an open conclusion into his death said. that he had two conflicting autopsy reports on Mr O’Grady’s cause of. death. But he said he preferred the conclusion of Dr Alison Armour in view of her accreditation by the Home Office. He. said: 'Dr Armour, she found no explanation for this young man’s sudden. death, no evidence of any natural disease to cause death or collapse. 'She disagrees with the conclusion of the Vietnamese post mortem. In her view the alcohol level was not at a level where fatality occurs, which is normally around 400mg. I prefer the conclusion of Dr Armor in view of her accreditation as Home Office pathologist. 'I’m satisfied that the cause of death must be recorded as unascertained rather than acute respiratory failure due to alcohol abuse, given the comparatively low level of alcohol which would lead to a moderate degree of intoxication but would not contribute to death. Home Office pathologist Dr Alison Armour said that the 212 microgrammes of of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood was not in the fatal range. 'There is no explanation for this man’s death and I formally record as unascertained. Cause of death could not be established.' Mr O’Grady was a former pupil of Our Lady’s High School in Lancaster and was a student at Preston College at the time of his death. Headteacher at Our Lady’s Catholic College, Mr Brendan Conboy, said: 'The community of Our Lady’s is deeply shocked and saddened by the untimely death of a popular and fondly regarded young man. 'Jake will be remembered for his vibrancy, his caring nature and for his friendly, outgoing manner. His family are in our thoughts and prayers.' A spokesman for Preston College: said: 'Jake had ambitions of being an adult nurse. He studied a Health and Social Care Level 2 course followed by an Access to Health professions course at Level 3, which would usually lead to further training in nursing or care work. 'Jake was a considerate, warm and passionate individual who was always supportive of other learners in the group both in their academic life and personal life. He studied with us for two years, progressing from a Level 2 diploma with a distinction star and then achieving a distinction in his Level 3 course. 'Jake made such a positive impact on his fellow students and his tutors, his ability and determination would have made Jake a top class nurse and he will always be in the memories of those who knew him. Our thoughts and sincere condolences are with Jake’s family.'\",\n",

We were not going to let him extort us. He didn\\'t like that answer.\" The man returned an hour later, \"carrying a long air-conditioner unit,\" according to Bay. \"He walked right up to me and tried to smack my face, but I ducked threw the air unit on the floor and pushed him away.\" Police officers providing security for the production \"jumped on him,\" Bay said. \"But it took seven big guys to subdue him. It was like a zombie in Brad Pitt\\'s movie \\'World War Z.\\' He lifted seven guys up and tried to bite them. He actually bit into one of the guard\\'s Nike shoe. Insane.

She said the men demanded that Bay give them 100,000 Hong Kong dollars, which is about $12,000 in U.S. currency. The younger Mak brother, who was charged with blackmail and assault on a police officer, was taken by ambulance to a hospital for treatment of his injuries, the spokeswoman said. The older bother, who complained that he was not feeling well, was arrested on a charge of common assault and assaulting a police officer, she said.

              " 'Thousands gathered in the Egyptian capital on Friday in a mass demonstration against the country\\'s armed forces and its heavy-handed treatment of protesters, which has since drawn international condemnation. Protesters could be seen erecting tents in Cairo\\'s Tahrir Square, a location widely considered the epicenter of an uprising that brought down Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak earlier this year. The move marks the latest in a series of protests around the capital, where at least 16 people were killed in recent days amid clashes with Egyptian authorities. The unrest appears to largely stem from a stretch of assaults by police and defiant protests by demonstrators demanding that Egypt\\'s ruling military cede power to a civilian government. Protesters on Friday could be heard singing the country\\'s national anthem and chanting slogans, such as \"The honor of Egyptian women is a red line.\" They also put up a large projector screen in the city\\'s square, which showed videos of violence against protesters and included testimonials by the injured and family members of those recently killed. Days of clashes were further stoked last weekend by the beating of a woman at the hands of military officers, prompting Tuesday\\'s so-called \"Million Women\" march, billed as an attempt to highlight regime violence against female demonstrators. Egypt\\'s ruling military council later expressed \"great regret\" to the women over recent attacks and vowed to hold accountable those responsible. Security forces, meanwhile, on Friday appeared largely absent from the demonstration, according to CNN personnel at the scene. But political groups such as the Muslim Brotherhood and its Freedom and Justice Party, as well as the Salfi Islamic Movement, said they were boycotting the events. The country\\'s Islamic Wasat Party, however, has decided to participate. Elsewhere in Cairo, hundreds of protesters converged on the city\\'s Abasya Square, chanting slogans such as \"No to Destruction.\" Large crowds also gathered in similar demonstrations in the Egyptian cities of Alexandria and Suez, according to state television. On Wednesday, Egypt\\'s military announced on Facebook that they had acquired information of a \"plan to vandalize government buildings and topple Egypt on January 25, 2012.\" The date would mark the one-year anniversary of the start of Egypt\\'s uprising that largely began in Tahrir square on January 25, 2011. Demonstrators have also called for the country\\'s presidential elections, scheduled to take place in June, to be moved ahead to instead take place on the anniversary. A Ministry of Health spokesman, meanwhile, said that some 30 ambulances have been stationed near Tahrir Square and a field hospital has been set-up in anticipation of possible clashes.',\n",

If you’re throwing this punch with your other hand, turn your nondominant wrist down while raising the elbow. The hook takes longer to throw than a straight punch, but it’s quite powerful when used correctly. Throw hooks when your opponent is really close to you to knock them off balance. A good hook also has a higher chance of knocking your opponent down, since you’re striking your opponent at an angle they aren’t expecting. The hook requires a small windup for maximum power. To put some weight behind your punch, bend your front leg down and in towards your body like you’re curling yourself up. Let your hip follow your knee like you’re twisting away from your opponent. Do not move your arms while doing this.  Your dominant hand should be directly behind your head at the end of this motion.

Maintain a bent elbow as you rotate your entire body towards your target. Pivot your back leg inwards while opening your front leg up to the target. Allow your punching arm to follow your hip and strike your opponent with your middle knuckle. When done correctly, this looks like your entire body is twisting forward like a hinge.

In fact any advertising of birth control will become illegal, Reuters notes, a stark turnaround for a nation that once promoted birth control and gave away condoms for free. So why is the Ayatollah Khamenei supporting the new bill and urging young Iranians to resist \"undesirable aspects of Western lifestyles\" by having bigger families? Because of Iran\\'s low birthrate, which has sunk to 1.8 children per woman, a full 0.3 children less than is needed to keep up the present population, IRNA reports. Iran had the opposite problem in the 1980s, when its population was growing too fast for the economy—so the government promoted birth control and required couples to have family-planning counseling before marriage. Women indeed had fewer babies, got more involved in the workforce, and eventually outnumbered men in higher education. \"Government officials were wrong on this matter, and I, too, had a part,\" Khamenei said in 2012. \"May God and history forgive us.\" Now critics say the new plan could cause a rise in abortions (which are only legal when a mother\\'s life is at risk), and may force women out of the workplace into \"traditional roles,\" reports the Post.

Stir it briskly with a fork or mini whisk to combine. Cook the mixture, stirring frequently, until it turns thick. Stir it with a whisk until the flour mixture dissolves and everything turns smooth. If your recipe calls for another type of condensed or \"cream of...\" soup, you can use a different type of stock. You can also dissolve some bouillon in ½ cup (120 milliliters) of water.  For a healthier option, use low-sodium chicken stock. To make cream of mushroom: cook some chopped mushrooms along with the butter. Add the flour and a spoonful of sour cream. If you are looking for a healthier soup base, use low-fat milk. You could also try a non-dairy milk if you are vegan or lactose-intolerant. How much salt and pepper you add is entirely up to you. If you are looking to restrict your sodium-intake, consider using less salt, and adding other spices instead. This soup is meant to be used as a substitute for canned, condensed soup in dishes such as casseroles and gravies.

The plot isn\\'t really that bad, but there are a few instances where you really have to ask yourself \"what the heck is going on here?\"\\n\\nThere are many many things that make this the funniest bad movie ever. First off, Rudy Ray Moore had gotten so fat and slow when this movie was filmed that the special effects consist of speeding up the fight scenes to double time. There are also scenes where there is a slow-motion instant replay, jumping onto a ten foot high wall (by playing falling off of it backwards), naked men walking out of huge letters, and sex that literally brings down the roof (with the cable holding up the roof catching on fire).\\n\\nOf course, no Rudy Ray Moore movie would be complete without a completely gratuitous and random comedy club scene where Rudy makes fun of all the customers, interposed with people doing some odd dance. There are so many things bad about this movie, but they\\'re bad in an entertaining way, and if you take your eyes off the movie, you might miss another mistake.\\n\\nRating: 1/10 for actual value, 10/10 for cheese factor, 10/10 for picking out mistakes and goofs, averages out to 7/10.',\n",

Dressed, partly dressed and naked she steals most of the film about love, sexual passion, philosophy and politics. For me the last two get a little lost and the ending is most confusing when her fiancé is released whilst fellow terrorists are released, she seems uncertain as to who she wants and the young lover seems more interested in his exams than anything else as she weeps, beautifully of course!\",\n",

During an interview for the magazine's 10th annual 'Reasons to Love New York issue', Mohammed refused to disclose his exact net worth, but he admitted it was in 'the high eight figures' and provided bank and financial paperwork to back that up. The successful teenager revealed he had used his incredible wealth to purchase a BMW - which he does not yet have a license to drive - and rent a\\xa0Manhattan\\xa0apartment. However, his parents, who are immigrants from the Bengal region of South Asia, will not yet allow him to move out of their family home in Queens, according to the New York Post. Mohammed has also taken to social media to show off his well-funded, lavish lifestyle - regularly posting videos of him partying, playing poker and dancing with numerous women on Instagram. His hard-earned cash has certainly been beneficial to his parents. 'My dad doesn't work now and I tend to help out with things, and futures gives me that incentive,' said the student.

But despite its advantages, Mr and Mrs Islam are not overly keen on their son's interest in trading. 'My dad doesn't like [finance] that much,' Mohammed, who has written the phrase, 'More money, less problems',  on his Instagram profile, said in an ISSUU interview. 'He says he is ok with me trading, but my mom is skeptical about the market. But they see it as, if I am good at it, then why not?' A year after he started experimenting with penny stocks, Mohammed was introduced to further financial markets by his cousin. He has since developed a 'life-long passion' for trading. 'What makes the world go round? Money,' he said. 'If money is not flowing, if businesses don’t keep going, there’s no innovation, no products, no investments, no growth, no jobs.' On his LinkedIn profile, the student said he rose to success while trading stocks during his lunch breaks because he 'followed the market, hunted for opportunities and used everything from fundamental analysis to technical analysis and price action to speculate in the markets'. After having high returns in penny stocks, he moved on to small-mid cap equities, then derivatives, before feeling out the futures market and specializing in  oil and gold, he said. He added he has now developed 'a passion for understanding the markets and a passion for making money', and trades 'mainly based on volatility and volume'.

Jones, 60, the billionaire founder of Tudor Investment Corporation, a private asset management firm and hedge fund, ranks as the 108th-richest American, according to Forbes. Mohammed said that while he had been 'paralyzed' by his losses when he first started trading, he quickly learned from Connecticut-based Jones's ability to get back into the game again and again. 'I had been paralyzed by my loss,' he said. 'But [Jones] was able to go back to it, even after losing thousands of dollars over and over.'

'He went through obstacles, yet still came out on top' And despite his massive fortune, Mohammed has no plans to give up trading just yet. The teenager said he and his trader friends hope to start a hedge fund in June - when he is old enough to get his broker-dealer license - and intend to make a billion dollars by next year. This, of course, will all be done while attending college. 'It’s not just about the money,' said Mohammed, whose ultimate goal is to pave a path in the financial industry that will enable him to become a reputable hedge fund manager.

              " 'In a historic fine, HSBC will pay out a record $1.92 billion to U.S. authorities to settle money laundering accusations -- activities which have allegedly occurred with drug cartels in Mexico and terror-linked groups in Saudi Arabia. U.S. authorities declared HSBC, the UK\\'s biggest bank by market capitalization, in breach of a series of U.S. laws, including the Trading with the Enemy Act. \"We accept responsibility for our past mistakes. We have said we are profoundly sorry for them, and we do so again. The HSBC of today is a fundamentally different organization from the one that made those mistakes,\" HSBC Group CEO Stuart Gulliver, said in a statement. On Monday, Standard Chartered, the UK\\'s second largest bank by market value, agreed to pay $327 million to settle U.S. Treasury Department charges of violating sanctions on transactions with Iran, Burma, Libya and Sudan between 2001 and 2007. In August  Standard Chartered paid $340 million to the state of New York\\'s Department of Financial Services to settle civil charges alleging it had concealed $250 billion in illegal transactions with Iran. But while this week\\'s fines are record fees, they are not earth-shattering when compared to the billions of dollars the banks boast in market values, assets and profits. According to Quartz, it will take HSBC a mere 41 days to earn back the $1.9 billion fine. \"These banks are big and you can argue that these kinds of settlements have some mitigating effect on risk-taking,\" says Gary Biddle, professor of accounting at the University of Hong Kong. But \"HSBC has about a $123 billion market cap today so its ($1.9 billion) fine is about 1%. This is not a huge amount. The stock price will vary that much in any given day anyway.\" Indeed, HSBC\\'s share price appears to have not suffered in light of these charges. In Hong Kong trading, HSBC Holdings rose 0.31% by mid-day Tuesday. Since news of HSBC\\'s allegations hit in mid-July, HSBC\\'s share price in Hong Kong has risen 16.3%. In the same time period in London trading, its share price has risen nearly 15%. Since the start of 2009, there have been at least 21 instances where global banks and financial institutions have been fined -- predominantly by U.S. authorities. Cases include a $536 million fine against Credit Suisse in December 2009 for allowing clients in Iran, Libya and Cuba to conduct financial transactions; a $335 million fine against Bank of America on racial discrimination charges in lending rates; and a $619 million fine against ING Bank NV that involved a cover-up of fund transfers that violated U.S. sanctions against Cuba and Iran. Biddle says bank improprieties will continue as long as governments continue to back them -- fallout from the 2008 financial crisis when the U.S. labeled some banks: \"Too big to fail.\" \"The obvious natural consequence of governments bailing out banks, or any industry for that matter,\" says Biddle, \"is that executives are able to take on more risk (and) governments bailing out banks puts us all at risk.\" The Dirty Dozen: Biggest fines of the banking world since 2009. 1. $1.9 billion, HSBC, December 2012.

              " \"By. Jonathan O'Callaghan. Consider two brothers who are identical twins. If one goes to space and the other does not, are they still genetically identical? That’s what Nasa will be aiming to discover in March 2015 in a ground-breaking experiment that will for the first time study the impact of space travel on the human body in real time, measuring any changes that occur between the two brothers as they happen. Living in space is known to have effects on the human body, including decreasing bone mass and causing muscle loss. Scroll down for video. Scott Kelly (left) will live aboard the ISS for a year while his twin brother Mark (right) stays on Earth. The two will be studied before, during and after the mission to see what effects space travel has on the human body. But, as of yet, we’re not quite sure what it does to the body on a smaller scale. For example, it could affect our DNA or alter how we age. To test out theories, Nasa is conducting an unprecedented twin experiment. In March 2015 Nasa astronaut Scott Kelly will join cosmonaut Mikhair Kornienko on a one-year mission aboard the International Space Station (ISS). The one-year mission is in itself interesting, as it will be the first time two humans have stayed aboard the ISS continuously for this period of time with missions to date lasting just six months. However, it is not the longevity of the mission that makes it interesting – while Scott is in space his identical twin brother Mark, a retired NASA astronaut, will remain on the ground as a ‘control’ in the experiment. Scott will spend a year orbiting Earth at 17,000 miles (27,000 km) per hour while Mark remains on Earth. Scott's one-year mission on the ISS with Russian cosmonaut Mikhail Kornienko will be the first long-duration stay on the station, with previous missions lasting only six months. ‘We will be taking samples and making measurements of the twins before, during and after the one-year mission,’ says Craig Kundrot of Nasa’s Human Research Program at the Johnson Space Center. For the first time Nasa will be able to monitor ‘two individuals who are genetically identical.’ Nasa recently announced the selection of ten research proposals to study the twins’ genetics, biochemistry, vision, cognition and more. ‘Each proposal is fascinating and could be a feature-length story of its own,’ says Kundrot. ‘We already known that the human immune system changes in space. ‘It’s not as strong as it is on the ground. ‘In one of the experiments, Mark and Scott will be given identical flu vaccines, and we will study how their immune systems react.’ Scott Kelly (left) is a current NASA astronaut with three previous missions under his belt, two aboard the Space Shuttle and one on the ISS. Mark Kelly (right), now retired, flew on four Space Shuttle missions. Scott Kelly's previous mission to the ISS was from 25 September 2010 to 16 March 2011. Here he's pictured in the Unity module playing with fruit in the weightless environment of the station. Mark Kelly peers out of the window of Space Shuttle Endeavour in May 2011. Around his neck is the ring of his wife, Gabrielle Giffords, a former US politician who was recovering from a gunshot would at the time after a failed assassination attempt. Another experiment will delve into whether humans age differently in orbit. On Earth, the loss of telomeres from human DNA has been linked to aging. This loss might be accelerated by cosmic rays. Comparing the twins’ telomeres will reveal if space travel is causing astronauts to age quicker. Among the other proposals will be experiments to monitor how vision is affected by space travel, while researchers will also delve into the psychological effects of being in space. The research, according to Nasa, could provide vital data with a view to one day sending astronauts to more distant destinations in space. The ‘twin paradox’ is a thought experiment proposed by Albert Einstein in the early 20th Century. It is derived from his theory of special relativity. Einstein suggests that the faster you travel, the slower you move through time. If one twin travelled in a spaceship near the speed of light, they would return home considerably younger than their sibling under laws of special relativity. Known as ‘time dilation,’ this was proven in 1971 with the Hafele-Keating experiment. Atomic clocks were set to the same time and then sent in different directions around the world in separate planes. The clocks were found to have ticked differently, proving special relativity.\",\n",

The full interview aired Sunday on CNN\\'s \"State of the Union.\" \\n  \\n Ryan was elected speaker Thursday, capping a tumultuous month for House Republicans which began when former Speaker John Boehner announced he was retiring from the House amid divisions in the Republican caucus. \\n  \\n Boehner, for whom Ryan volunteered during his first run for Congress in 1990, offered his own thoughts on Ryan\\'s future in an interview with Bash just before he left the House. \\n  \\n Read More ||||| Photo Advertisement Continue reading the main story \\n  \\n WASHINGTON — Speaker Paul D. Ryan said in a series of televised interviews on Sunday that he would not work with the Obama administration on changing immigration policy, effectively pushing off the issue to at least 2017. \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n “Look, I think it would be a ridiculous notion to try and work on an issue like this with a president we simply cannot trust on this issue,” Mr. Ryan, Republican of Wisconsin, said in an interview with CBS’s “Face the Nation.” “He tried to go it alone, circumventing the legislative process with his executive orders, so that is not in the cards.” \\n  \\n The message from Mr. Ryan, who was elected speaker on Thursday, signaled an antagonism toward the White House that both echoed his predecessor, John A. Boehner, and is likely to appeal to the party conservatives who forced Mr. Boehner’s resignation. \\n  \\n Mr. Ryan taped five Sunday morning news shows, in which he laid out his agenda for unifying his party and his approach to relationships with congressional colleagues, Mr. Obama and Republican presidential candidates. \\n  \\n When asked to comment on the statements about immigration, a White House spokesman referred to a news briefing Friday by Josh Earnest, the press secretary, who described the speaker’s stance as “a source of deep disappointment.” \\n  \\n Mr. Ryan said that if the Republicans were to be a successful opposition party between now and the presidential election, they would need to become an aggressive “proposition party,” laying out a clear policy vision with alternatives to Democrats, like plans for overhauling the tax code and replacing the Affordable Care Act. \\n  \\n “We have been too timid for too long around here,” Mr. Ryan said on ABC’s “This Week.” “We have been bold on tactics but not on policy, not on an agenda. We have to show people what our alternatives are, and that is the kind of leadership I think people are hungry for here.” \\n  \\n Such proactive agenda-setting, Mr. Ryan added, will help avert the kind of brinkmanship over spending that was common under Mr. Boehner’s leadership. It also requires that congressional leaders be “honest with people up front about what it is you can and cannot achieve,” Mr. Ryan said in response to a question on CNN’s “State of the Union” about defunding Planned Parenthood. \\n  \\n Mr. Ryan repeatedly made it clear that he would take an approach different from that of Mr. Boehner, whose almost five-year tenure as speaker was rife with Republican Party infighting. In a nod to the conservatives who have demanded that power in the House be decentralized, Mr. Ryan said the speaker’s job was to facilitate consensus, not to be “dictator of the House.” \\n  \\n “I don’t think leadership should be trying to, you know, covet power and write legislation,” he said on “Fox News Sunday.” “I think I want to have a more participatory process, which is really what the founders envisioned the House to look like. And that is something that so many of us, myself included, have been concerned about the way this place has been run.” \\n  \\n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \\n  \\n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \\n  \\n Mr. Ryan, the Republican Party’s 2012 vice-presidential nominee, said he would remain neutral in the Republican presidential nomination race. The Republican presidential aspirants, he added, have offered a model for the kind of policy alternatives he hopes to see in the House. \\n  \\n “I looked at that stage and said every one of these people would be a far better president than Hillary Clinton,” he said on ABC. \\n  \\n Mr. Ryan briefly addressed his personal qualms with taking the speaker’s job, which he said he had never wanted. His thinking underwent “a metamorphosis over a few weeks,” Mr. Ryan said, as he realized the role he could play in “wiping the slate clean” in the House and the way it conducts business. \\n  \\n As he made clear when he was being courted to accept the position, Mr. Ryan said that as speaker he would continue commuting every week between Washington and his home in Janesville, Wis., where his wife and three young children live. In Washington, he will continue to sleep in his old office in the House, rather than the speaker’s suite, which members of his staff were trying to rid of the odor from Mr. Boehner’s cigarettes. \\n  \\n Asked by “Fox News Sunday” how long he expected his honeymoon as speaker to last, Mr. Ryan offered a quick joke. \\n  \\n “About 35 minutes,” he said. |||||',\n",
              " 'We went to Long Animal Hospital for a couple of years and had to stop going over a series of really bad encounters and mishaps.   They are a well-established clinic in a good location; however, it is a bit run-down and you\\'ll definitely see rusting, paint chipping and questionable cleanliness if you go often enough. We haven\\'t been there in a few years, however, Dr. Killough, Sr stands out as a vet we would never go to again after the very rough handling we experienced with our older, very sweet and gentle, greyhound. He treated her like she was a truck on an assembly line and after that visit alone, she started getting panic attacks everytime we would go thereafter (it was her first time seeing Dr. Killough, Sr after going to the practice for over 3 years).   Second, they \"forgot\" to give her a Bordatella vaccination (for over 3 years) even though we saw them regularly, we had her original paperwork/vaccination schedule sent when we first got her and they did her vaccinations each year. We were going on a weekend trip and keeping her at a boarding facility, had their vaccinations sent over and the facility promptly called us to tell us she didn\\'t have her Bordatella - kind of important.  Third, they prescribed incorrect dosages to our 2nd greyhound who had heart issues. In fact, they diagnosed him with all his heart issues and kept putting him on different meds - each time we would go in, their diagnosis would change (his heart murmur went from a grade 2 to a grade 6, then to a 5) - he had high blood pressure, then he didn\\'t, then he did again. He had an enlarged heart, then it was normal (ex-racers are naturally larger) and then it was again. Get the picture? We took him to NCSU vet school and they said it was around a grade 4 and that his medication strengths were all off. They sent all the results and paperwork back to Long\\'s. I am guessing they didn\\'t read it, because our next visit to Long\\'s, they re-upped his medications (he was on 3 different medications). He started having kidney issues (and what dog wouldn\\'t on all those meds?) and the prescription bottle dosage changed *again* -- I called them and they had no idea what dosage he was on, or what he should be on or why this bottle was different than the last. I asked them to review what NCSU sent over, which they did, and I had to go back, again, to get his \"true\" medications and dosages. What a mess. We later took him to a canine cardiologist in Charlotte (she had just started practicing here) and she was appalled at all the changes in his diagnoses, medications and dosages. His health definitely suffered as a result of inadequate care and he died, of heart failure, when he was barely 8 years old. Long\\'s just wasn\\'t capable of treating his condition.  By the time we were forced to leave, both our dogs were having panic attacks when going there (something they didn\\'t have at first, and didn\\'t have at the next vet clinic we went to). We didn\\'t have a regular vet, we saw all of them there and perhaps that is why they never seemed to know what the heck had gone on with our dogs before that visit (we ended up having to tell them our dogs\\' histories, which sucks, since THEY had their records). Maybe they were too busy to read charts, maybe we got them on bad days, I don\\'t know - but I believe a vet should at least skim an animal\\'s record before walking in and seeing them again. Why should I have to tell you what meds my dog is on? Why should I have to tell them what they diagnosed last time?   Finally, we never used them for boarding, but the boarding conditions are insanely bad. They are outdoor cages attached to the main clinic building. Dogs were completely exposed to the elements AND to anyone walking to the backside of the clinic. Perhaps they\\'ve upgraded in the last couple years, but even if they have, I find it pretty bothersome that dogs would sit in a cage in winter, the dead of summer, through rainstorms and potentially have some random person do something to them because they are in outdoor cages. I could never understand how anyone could leave their dog in those conditions.  We didn\\'t try them one time, have one bad experience, and leave - we went there for over three years and it was one headache after another. I will say that the front office staff were all incredibly nice. They knew our dogs by name within a visit or two and were very welcoming when we came. We also had some good experiences with the vets there, which is why we went there for so long -- but the bad experiences, in the end, outweighed the good and we left. We aren\\'t looking for anything fancy-schmancy (as another reviewer mentioned) - but we expect them to know what\\'s going on with our dogs, diagnose them correctly, give them correct meds with correct doses, have a clean practice and humane boarding conditions -- oh, and maybe be gentle with the animals when necessary. Is that too much to ask?',\n",

George C. Scott plays a convincing and mean Ebenezer Scrooge, and the actors playing the ghosts are rather frightening and menacing. David Warner is a good Bob Cratchit as well.\\n\\nThis version is beautifully filmed, and uses more modern filming styles (for the 1980's) which make it more palatable for my children than the 1951 black and white version.\\n\\nThis is a worthy adaptation of the story and is one that I watch almost every year at some point in the Christmas season.\",\n",
              " '– Residents of San Francisco\\'s leaning luxury condo tower have come up with a $100 million solution to be put in place as soon as this winter. Homeowners at the 58-story Millennium Tower, which has sunk 18 inches and tilted 14 inches since its construction, plan to submit a permit application Tuesday to drill 52 new steel and concrete piles securing the 10-foot-thick concrete mat foundation into bedrock 250 feet below, reports the San Francisco Chronicle. The 140,000-pound piles installed on the north and west sides of the tower would reverse its 14-inch tilt to the west by relieving stress on the soft soil compressing beneath, designer and engineer Ronald Hamburger of Simpson Gumpertz & Heger tells the Chronicle, which notes the work should take 18 months without much disturbance to residents. The 419-unit tower currently has 950 reinforced concrete piles driven up to 90 feet deep, along with cracks in the foundation and windows, per Business Insider. \"While the city and other experts have always certified the building as safe, this solution will eliminate any lingering questions about its stability,\" the president of the Millennium Tower Association\\'s Center Board of Directors tells the Chronicle. A rep for developer Millennium Partners, which faces multiple lawsuits, adds the retrofit would make the tower \"one of the safest buildings in California.\" Original developer Mission Street Development has agreed to perform the work, with the funds coming out of an eventual settlement. Work could begin in late winter or early spring, if approved by a panel of experts. (Pisa\\'s Leaning Tower has lost some of its tilt.)',\n",

As flu season continues to wreak havoc across the US, Brian Herndon has been recuperating and drifting in and out of consciousness for weeks at Dallas\\' Baylor University Medical Center, where he was airlifted on Jan. 6 after being diagnosed with the flu just 48 hours earlier. The 51-year-old father of two was also hit with pneumonia, and soon after he was admitted to a Fort Worth hospital on Jan. 5 he went into septic shock. Doctors were forced to amputate both of his legs below the knee and nine of his fingers after the septic shock caused blood clots to form. Herndon\\'s wife, Jaye, tells NBC 5 that he hadn\\'t had a flu shot this year, and that the illness progressed so rapidly he\\'d never even had a chance to take the Tamiflu he was given when he was initially diagnosed. \"He had a 104.7 temperature right away,\" she tells WFAA. \"And then he had trouble breathing.

              " 'It\\'s 35 years after the release of Fleetwood Mac\\'s groundbreaking album \"Rumours,\" and Stevie Nicks and Lindsey Buckingham are holding hands. Maybe it\\'s true that absence makes the heart grow fonder. Or maybe it\\'s a put-on, knowing that fans are still intrigued by the complicated interpersonal drama that drives the band. \"Rumours\" gave listeners a voyeuristic peek into the messy romantic lives of the quintet. \"Go Your Own Way\" was Buckingham\\'s anguished kiss-off to Nicks. \"Don\\'t Stop\" was Christine McVie\\'s song of encouragement to her soon-to-be ex-husband, John McVie. A special anniversary reissue of \"Rumours\" is now available, with expanded and deluxe versions featuring previously unreleased demos and early takes, along with a dozen live recordings from the group\\'s 1977 world tour. At 35, still the \\'perfect album\\' In April, Nicks and Buckingham will join drummer Mick Fleetwood and bassist John McVie for their first tour in three years. In addition to their arsenal of beloved hits, they\\'re hoping to crowd-test three newly recorded tracks. \"We have two brand new songs and one really, really old song,\" Nicks said. The \"old\" tune predates Fleetwood Mac: an unreleased nugget written for the \"Buckingham Nicks\" LP, which marks its 40th anniversary this year. The two \"new\" tracks were penned by Buckingham. Last year, he went into the studio with Fleetwood and McVie to record eight songs they hoped would become the catalyst for a new Fleetwood Mac album. But Nicks had reservations. \"We really didn\\'t want to rent a house for a year and then make a whole record with 13, 14, 15 songs on it, then have most of the people who are thinking about buying it buy one song,\" she explained. \"So we did the three songs, and we\\'ll see how the world reacts to that. If they love those three songs, then maybe they might talk us into doing something else.\" Maybe Nicks and Buckingham\\'s hand-holding isn\\'t for the cameras. Maybe it\\'s to remind each other that despite their differences, they remain personally supportive and unified in their commitment to the juggernaut that is Fleetwood Mac -- even if it means playing mostly vintage hits for their upcoming tour. \"That\\'s okay,\" Buckingham conceded. \"That\\'s part and parcel with what we do.\" \"We laugh,\" added Nicks, \"but (the classics are) why we all have a beautiful house.\"',\n",

              " \"When preparing shelving, take a look at the rest of your room. Notice any common colors in your furniture, walls, and flooring. Chances are a few colors appear in your room more often than others. Alter the rest of the room along with your shelf decorations to include these colors.  A room theme works best when the colors you choose are interspersed throughout the room. For instance, if your room has a nautical theme, you could include white china and blue books on your shelves. The characteristics of the shelving and decorations you use should change depending on the room. Select each item carefully so it matches with the overall aesthetic of the room. Modern shelving or decorations may look out of place in a room designed to appear rustic. If you have a modern room with sleek, dark furniture, you might want to use metal shelves. Then, decorate the shelves with metal picture frames, electronics, and colorful displays. Open shelves are a focal point in a room, so you don't want the wall behind it to stand out. A neutral shade like white often works well. You can also use light colors such as a pale blue or wood paneling. Avoid dark, drab colors, since these contrast against most decorations. To highlight a few select items on open shelves, you can paint the wall behind it a bold color. Or, you can add patterned wallpaper. This adds a fun pop of color and directs the eye toward the shelves. Leave some walking space between the shelves and furniture. Also, after the work you probably went through in arranging the shelves, you won't want to obscure the decor behind a large couch. Move furniture away so the shelves are visible.  Placing a large chair near a shelf can be distracting. The size of the chair draws eyes to it, so your shelves will likely be underappreciated. If you want furniture near the shelves, restrict it to a single small chair if possible. Or, make sure the furniture is a solid or neutral color so the area doesn't look too busy. This includes the walls as well as the floor. Let the shelves stand alone. Try not to hang any large or gaudy wall art next to the shelves. Also, avoid placing large cabinets or additional shelving units nearby, since this can cause your space to look overcrowded.  Distracting wall decorations can include bright wall paint, wallpaper, posters, and framed art. Intersperse other storage and shelving units throughout your home to create consistency. If you wish to place other eye-catching decorations nearby, make your shelves less of a focal point. To do this, store less items on the shelves. Choose mostly items with neutral colors, such as white.  Keep your room balanced by not drawing attention from nearby decorations. For example, a fancy framed painting may be on the wall. If you don't move it, it will be the first item anyone sees when they step into the room. Periodically check your room to keep your decor up to date. Clean up any clutter and eliminate any items that no longer belong there. Refill your shelves with new items to keep your decor fresh. Adjust any wall decorations or nearby furniture as needed to keep the room fresh.  Even rearranging the items on your shelving can make your decor look new again. You may want to change up your decor based on the season as well. For instance, you could add Christmas decor around the holidays or include brighter items during the summer.\",\n",

He is likely to face additional charges as the investigation moves forward, said Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa. Harry Burkhart remains jailed without bail and is scheduled to appear in court Wednesday. \\n  \\n \"What did you do to my son,\" Dorothee Burkhart, yelled at the judge during her hearing Tuesday. \"My son is disappeared since yesterday. Perhaps the German Nazis know of our address.\" \\n  \\n It did not appear that she knew her son had been arrested a day earlier on the arson charge. \\n  \\n She turned down an offer of a court-appointed lawyer and was given until her next hearing Friday to hire a defense attorney. \\n  \\n A federal extradition complaint said she is wanted in Germany on 19 counts of fraud, including an allegation that she defrauded the doctor who performed breast augmentation surgery on her in 2004. The other fraud charges center on rent and security deposits for apartments in Frankfurt, Germany, the complaint said. \\n  \\n A website advertising \"sensual tantra massage\" and offering \"full body hot oil body to body sliding massage\" is registered to Dorothee Burkhart using a Hollywood address, according to a domain registry database. She lived with her son in a Hollywood apartment, according to the complaint. \\n  \\n Investigators seized press clippings of arson attacks in Germany from the apartment, according to a law enforcement official who spoke on the condition of anonymity. \\n  \\n Dorothee Burkhart last entered the United States lawfully in January 2007 and left the country four months later, according to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. She currently has no lawful immigration status and ICE has lodged an immigration detainer against her, it said. \\n  \\n A court document released earlier on Tuesday incorrectly stated that Dorothee Burkhart had most recently entered the United States in October, according to ICE. \\n  \\n Harry Burkhart was in the United States lawfully at the time of his arrest on a non-immigrant visa, which expires on January 18, ICE said. The agency has similarly lodged an immigration detainer against him. \\n  \\n Arson investigators counted 52 fires, most starting in parked cars, since Friday morning, but none since the suspect was detained at 3 a.m. Monday, according to officials. \\n  \\n No one was hurt in the fires, but property damage is likely to reach $3 million, said Los Angeles Fire Chief Brian Cummings. \\n  \\n U.S. State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said Tuesday that after Los Angeles police released a surveillance video of a man seen near the scene of one fire, agents in the department\\'s Bureau of Diplomatic Security field office recognized Burkhart. \\n  \\n Multiple CNN affiliates reported the alleged arson spree could have stemmed from a deportation battle between the suspect and immigration officials involving Burkhart\\'s mother. \\n  \\n After his arrest, Burkhart told investigators, \"I hate America,\" according to CNN affiliate KABC. \\n  \\n Los Angeles Police Chief Charlie Beck said officials believe -- and hope -- the fires were set by one person. But they will proceed as though others may be involved until they know for sure, Beck said. \\n  \\n \"I feel very good that we\\'ve got the right guy. (The suspect) had the right stuff in his van, and we are confident in the arrest,\" Beck said. \\n  \\n Neighbor Galina Larimoda told KABC-TV through a Russian translator that Harry Burkhart knocked on her door Sunday and seemed angry and not \"completely normal.\" \\n  \\n Los Angeles County Reserve Sheriff\\'s Deputy Shervin Lalezary, who draws a salary of $1 a year, was hailed as a hero for arresting Burkhart. \\n  \\n Lalezary, an Iranian-born lawyer who moonlights as a deputy, pulled over a van in Hollywood driven by a man who resembled the person seen on the surveillance video. With the help of backup officers, he then arrested the driver, Burkhart. ||||| CBS2 See our report about Burkhart\\'s mother being linked to an erotic massage business here. First posted at 7:59 p.m. Monday \\n  \\n The man who terrorized L.A. for three nights with a series of 53 arson fires turned out to be a 24-year-old from Germany identified as Harry Burkhart, at least according to authorities. \\n  \\n \"I hate America\" were the words he reportedly uttered after he was pulled out of his car during a traffic stop at Sunset Boulevard near Fairfax Avenue shortly after 3 this morning following another outbreak of fires in nearby West Hollywood. \\n  \\n Burkhart was booked into jail at 1:48 p.m. and held in lieu of $250,000, according to the L.A. County Sheriff\\'s Department\\'s inmate information database. \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n A rookie deputy on duty in the area recognized the dark Dodge/Chrysler minivan with Canadian plates the suspect was driving as one wanted in connection with the fires. He made a traffic stop and about a few dozen fellow deputies swarmed. \\n  \\n @Venice311 \\n  \\n Later authorities said Burkhart resembled a man seen leaving the area of a car fire in the Hollywood+Highland subterranean garage Saturday. Security video of that suspect was released to the public. It showed a wide man in black with a ponytail. \\n  \\n Burkhart had his hair in a ponytail during the stop this morning and seemed to smirk as bystanders snapped shots of him. \\n  \\n At a 6:15 p.m. news conference Sheriff Lee Baca called the suspect \"the most dangerous arsonist in Los Angeles County that I can recall.\\'\\' \\n  \\n At an earlier conference Capt. Jamie Moore said he expected that arson charges would formally be filed against the man. \\n  \\n Two fires had broken out in West Hollywood in the wee hours Monday, not far from where Burkhart was stopped (reportedly with charcoal briquettes in his car). \\n  \\n @GigiGraciette \\n  \\n LAPD radio traffic indicated a suspect might have started in the Valley, igniting telltale vehicle-in-carport fires in Sherman Oaks and North Hollywood, before heading south, leaving a swath of smoldering destruction in his path. \\n  \\n In all there were 11 arson fires connected to the spree early this morning, including the two in West Hollywood, two in Hollywood and seven in the San Fernando Valley. \\n  \\n The L.A. Arson Watch Task Force also assigned these blazes to the suspect: \\n  \\n During the early morning hours of Friday, December 30, 2011, a series of 17 car/structure fires developed; five in West Hollywood and 12 in Hollywood. Following this series of fires a Joint Arson Task Force comprised of the Los Angeles City Fire Department, Los Angeles Police Department, the Los Angeles County Sheriff\\'s Department, the County of Los Angeles Fire Department, the District Attorney\\'s Office, and the Federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives was assembled. In the early evening hours of Friday, December 30, 2011, and through the early morning hours of Saturday, December 31, 2011, 16 additional vehicle/structure fires occurred; four in Hollywood, 11 in North Hollywood, and one in Sunland. An additional car fire occurred in the City of Burbank. On Saturday evening, December 31, 2011, 8 additional car/structure fires occurred; 6 in Hollywood and two in West Hollywood. \\n  \\n Strangely, the spree of fires in Hollywood actually started Thursday, when about four blazes broke out and two suspects were arrested. So far, that leg of our four-night fire nightmare, and those suspects, have not been connected to Burkhart\\'s alleged rampage. \\n  \\n And the blazes continued Friday through this morning, resulting in about $2 million damage and no civilian injuries, officials said. \\n  \\n The Los Angeles Times reported today that Burkhart might have been angered over the deportation of a relative, subsequently said to be his mother, only a week ago. \\n  \\n [Update at 10:15 p.m.]: The Los Angeles Times reports that it appears a U.S. State Department source pointed to Burkhart after he unleashed an anti-American tirade in U.S. immigration court recently, apparently in reaction to his mother\\'s reported deportation: A government official recognized him as resembling the man in the Hollywood+Highland surveillance video and alerted local authorities. \\n  \\n A be-on-the-lookout alert for Burkhart\\'s Dodge minivan was issued, and a reserve deputy ID\\'d by KCAL9/CBS2 news as Shervin Lalezary spotted a suspect early this morning. \\n  \\n The Times reported Burkhart had \"travel papers\" from Chechnya even though he\\'s a German national. \\n  \\n KCAL9/CBS2\\'s Serene Branson found out from neighbors living adjacent to Burkhart\\'s apartment at 7274 Sunset Boulevard indicated his mother lived with him until recently. \\n  \\n [Added]: One woman told the station that the mother had indicated to hear that her son wasn\\'t all right in the head. \\n  \\n - \\n  \\n @GiovanniAgnelli \\n  \\n That location is centered between many of the Hollywood and West Hollywood fires, was within walking distance of Hollywood+Highland, and is even doors away from a blaze on Pointsettia Place, as KCAL9/CBS2 noted. \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n View Larger Map \\n  \\n Lalezary, by the way, was described as a reserve deputy with 3-and-half years under his belt and a fulltime job as ... an attorney. \\n  \\n @NewsJuan / Juan Fernandez of CBS2/KCAL9 \\n  \\n [Added]: The damage estimate for the spree that lasted from Friday to Monday was increased from $2 million to $3 million, according to City News Service. \\n  \\n [With reporting from City News Service / @dennisjromero / djromero@laweekly.com / @LAWeeklyNews] \\n  \\n  |||||',\n",

It\\'s unclear why, though he notes a warrant is needed without compliance from the property owner.

He\\'ll have to \"ensure that gains in Afghanistan and Iraq are not erased in the aftermath of US troop withdrawals,\" and now\\'s his chance to make amends with Syria. Holman W.

Obama won\\'t have much time to sip champagne before he has to make decisions that could \"define priorities that will shape the rest of his presidency,\" writes Peter Baker in the New York Times. For one, the looming financial cliff and automatic tax increases will have to be dealt with, and Iran\\'s nuclear program demands prompt attention.

A bowling lane is 60 feet (18.3\\xa0m) long from the foul line, the line closest to the bowler, to the head pin, the pin closest to the bowler. There are gutters on either side of the bowling lane. If a ball veers off the lane, it goes into the gutters and is out of play.  The approach area is 15 feet (4.6\\xa0m) long and ends at the foul line. The bowler cannot overstep the foul line during their approach or their shot won\\'t count. If a ball goes into the gutters and then bounces out and hits the pins, it won\\'t count. Ten pins are arranged at the end of the bowling lane at the beginning of every frame. They are arranged in a triangle formation, with the point of the triangle facing the bowler. There is one pin in the first row, which is the head pin, two pins in the second row, three in the third, and four in the fourth.  The locations of the pins are assigned numbers 1-10. The pins in the back row have the numbers 7-10, the pins in the row above the back row are numbered 4-6, the pins in the second row are numbered 2-3, and the head pin is pin 1. All pins will earn the bowler one point if they are hit. The numbers are based on location, not value. Before you can call yourself a true bowler, you should be aware of a few different bowling terms. Knowing these terms will also make it much easier for you to understand the rules. Here they are:  A strike is when you knock down all the pins with the ball on your first try. A spare is when you knock down all the pins on your second try. A split is when the first ball of a frame knocks down the headpin (the pin closest to you) but leaves two or more pins that are non-adjacent. It\\'s tough to hit a spare in this situation, especially if you have a 7-10 split, which is the hardest split to hit. A turkey is three strikes in a row. If any pins remain after the bowler\\'s turn, it\\'s called an \"open frame.\" One bowling game consists of 10 frames. Each frame is equal to one turn for the bowler. The bowler\\'s objective is to knock down as many pins as possible in a frame, ideally all of them.  A bowler can roll the ball twice in each frame, provided that they do not hit a strike. A bowler gets an extra turn on the tenth frame if they knock down all the pins on the first turn. If a bowler has an open frame, then they simply get credit for the number of pins they knocked down. If a bowler knocked down 6 pins after two turns, they simply get two turns. However, if a bowler hits a spare or a strike, the rules get slightly more complicated.  If a bowler hits a spare, then they should place a slash mark on their score sheet. After their next turn, they will receive 10 points plus the number of pins they knock down with that turn. So if they knock down 3 pins after their first turn, then they will get 13 points before their second turn. If they then knock down 2 pins in their second turn, they get a total of 15 points for that round. If a bowler hits a strike, they should record an X on their scoresheet. The strike will earn the bowler ten points plus the number of pins knocked down on the player\\'s next two turns in the following round. The most a bowler can score in one game is 300 points. This represents 12 strikes in a row, or 120 pins that were knocked down in 12 frames. A perfect game has 12 strikes and not ten, because if the bowler gets a strike on the last frame, then they can take two more turns. If those two turns are also strikes, they will have 300 points. If a player rolls a spare in the last frame, then they can take one more turn.',\n",
              " 'Coinciding with the start of the baby boom, the years after World War II saw an unprecedented exodus of Americans moving out of their city apartments into the suburbs where they can fulfill their dreams of owning their own homes. Directed by H.C. Potter and co-written by Norman Panama and Melvin Frank (\"White Christmas\"), this lightweight but surprisingly observant 1948 screwball comedy captures the feeling of that period very well. Of course, it helps to have a trio of expert farceurs \\x96 Cary Grant, Myrna Loy and an especially acerbic Melvyn Douglas \\x96 head the proceedings with their natural likability at odds with the escalating frustrations of home ownership. Even though the film is sixty years old now, there is a timeless quality to the Blandings\\' dream and the barriers they face in achieving it. Obviously, Hollywood thinks so since it\\'s been remade at least twice - first as a very physical Tom Hanks comedy, 1986\\'s \"The Money Pit\", and again last year with Ice Cube\\'s \"Are We Done Yet?\". One look at HGTV\\'s programming schedule will show you how the situations explored here still resonate today.\\n\\nThe plot begins with ad man Jim Blandings, his wife Muriel and their two daughters cramped into a two bedroom-one bath Manhattan apartment. Rather than pursue Muriel\\'s idea to renovate the apartment for $7,000, Jim sees a photo of a Connecticut house in a magazine and realizes this is where they need to move. With the help of an opportunistic real estate agent and against the advice of their attorney and family friend Bill Cole, the Blandings decide to buy a ramshackle house badly in need of repair. However, the foundation sags so badly that the house needs to be torn down in favor of a new one. This sparks the Blandings to push the architect to design a house so excessive that the second floor is twice as big as the first. Costs rise with each new complication, tempers flare, and even a romantic triangle is imagined among, Jim, Muriel and Bill. Priorities finally sort themselves out but not before some funny slapstick scenes and clever dialogue that tweaks the not-so-blissful ignorance of the new homeowners.\\n\\nWith his double takes and flawless line delivery, Grant is infallible in this type of farce, and Jim Blandings epitomizes his more domesticated mid-career characters. In a role originally meant for Irene Dunne, Myrna Loy shows why she was Hollywood\\'s perfect wife. She doesn\\'t get many of the funnier lines, but she combines her special blend of flightiness and sauciness to make Muriel an appealing character on her own. Watch her deftly maneuver the overly agreeable house painter with her absurdly idiosyncratic color palette. As avuncular, pipe-smoking Bill (\"Cole\\x85Bill Cole\"), Melvyn Douglas shows his natural, easy-going élan as Grant\\'s foil. Smaller roles are filled expertly with particularly memorable turns by Harry Shannon as the laconic well-digger Mr. Tesander, Lurene Tuttle as Jim\\'s officious assistant Mary, and Louise Beavers as the Blandings\\' lovable maid Gussie. The 2004 DVD provides some intriguing vintage material including two radio versions of the movie - the first a 1949 version that did end up pairing Grant and Dunne and then a second 1950 version coupling Grant with his then-wife, actress Betsy Drake. A most appropriate 1949 cartoon, \"The House of Tomorrow\", is also included giving us a comical tour of a futuristic dream house. The original theatrical trailers for ten of Grant\\'s film classics complete the extras.',\n",

The STORY of 7EVENTY 5IVE, on the other hand, is that of a horror film that had a wee little bit of promise, sadly outweighed by really bad writing.\\n\\nWhat could have been a fun, if somewhat silly, old-fashioned slasher tale is derailed early on by its filmmakers' misguided belief that the audience would enjoy watching a bunch of loud, whiny rich kids bitching at each other for most of the film's running time. With the exception of a police detective played by Rutger Hauer, (in a minor role that is designed mainly to add the movie's only star power) every character on screen is a different breed of young A-hole.\\n\\nMale and female, black and white, straight and gay, an entire ensemble of shallow and shrill college kids carries the bulk of the film's narrative. Worse, since the tale deals with a PARTY game gone awry, most of the time the scenes are completely filled with these little b*****ds. Because of this, there are few breaks for the viewer, who must put up with the angry sniping of the thinly-drawn protagonists. Even though at least some of these people are supposedly friends, invariably all characters interact in a very hostile manner, long before any genuine conflict has actually arisen. This leads to the worst possible result in a slasher film: The audience, intended to care about the leads, instead not only cheers on the anonymous killer, but wishes that he had arrived to start picking off the vacuous brats far earlier.\\n\\nThe real shame of this poor characterization is that otherwise 7EVENTY 5IVE actually DID have some potential. Visually it's fine. First-time directors Brian Hooks and Deon Taylor know how to build a suspenseful mood. They also manage to deliver on some competent, if sparse, moments of classic 80s-style gore. Surprisingly, the production's cast is also fairly able. It isn't that the actors aren't capable of expressing realistic human emotion; it is simply that the screenplay (co-written by newcomer Vashon Nutt and director Hooks, who fared much better behind the camera than with a keyboard) is short of such moments.\\n\\n7EVENTY 5IVE can hardly be recommended, as its familiar premise and few thrills can't outweigh the bad taste left behind by a story driven by a gaggle of unpleasant characters. In this tepid whodunnit, the real mystery is why anyone should care about a group of young folk who can't even manage to like each other.\",\n",

The Royal Mail is refusing to make deliveries to 90 homes on a housing estate - because of one 'aggressive' dog. Residents in Salford have been sent a letter warning them their post has been temporarily suspended for health and safety reasons after two postmen were confronted by the animal. One of the men allegedly had to defend himself with his postbag - which was damaged in the attack. Neither of the postmen were bitten. The letter was sent on February 7 to households in and around Briar Hill Avenue in Little Hulton. Post-traumatic: Almost 100 homes in and around Briar Hill Avenue (pictured) have to travel four miles to collect their mail because of an aggressive dog at just one property. The three streets, comprising 90 houses, that will not get mail delivered thanks to the dog. It said a health and safety assessment showed the level of risk was 'unacceptably high due to threat of further dog attacks'. It. apologised for the inconvenience - and told residents they would have. to travel four miles to collect their mail from a delivery office. The canine culprit is a dog named Jarvis who lives with owner Victoria Ludlow, 36, and her cat called Brian. She was not available for comment. Today one neighbour of Miss Ludlow said: 'This all seems like an over-reaction. The home where Jarvis the dog and owner Vicky Ludlow are believed to live. A Royal Mail van travelling through the Briar Hill Estate in Salford today. Residents will now need to pick there own mail up from the delivery office in Worsley. 'Jarvis is a great dog who is often let out onto the drive way and he runs through the broken down fence into the park next door but he never harms anyone - he just doesn't like postmen that's all. 'He is always plays with the kids on the park and they don't get scared by him despite him being a big dog and as far I'm aware no-one else gets threatened by him. 'He's a great dog - it's just that he seems to have an intense hatred of postmen. A park next to Briar Hill Avenue where the dog is believed to play. 'He does get aggressive when they come - I can only assume its to do with the uniforms or the fact they sometimes wear high-visibility jackets. 'Not so long ago there was a broken. street light outside the house and a man fixing the telephone mast was. wearing a hi-vis jacket. Jarvis came bounding out barking at the bottom. of the light at the man and he was stuck up there for absolutely ages. Brian Lowe (left), 73, is furious that so many houses are being punished for one dog. Tony Lee, 33,\\xa0 says deliveries only need to be stopped at the address where the dog lives. 'I can understand that the postmen. don't want to come near a dog if it's going to jump at them like but on. the other hand why don't they just complain to police. 'If they have a problem with one. house they shouldn't be stopping the post down the whole street - its. ridiculous. Vicky has Jarvis, the dog, and a cat called Brian. 'We've lived here a year and only. spoken to her maybe four times. She keeps herself to herself but we have. no trouble from her or the dog. If he barks at us we tell him to get. down and he does every time.' The Royal Mail said it was working with the dog's owner to find a solution. The mail boycott has divided the estate. Tony. Lee, 33, said: 'I don't know the owner but I've never had any trouble. from that dog. It's blatantly obvious to me that they only need to stop. deliveries at the address where the dog is, not all these homes.' The letter residents received. It says the risks of delivering to their area is 'unacceptably high' due to the dog (file picture) Neighbour. Brian Lowe, 73, a great grandfather of three, added: 'It's absolute. rubbish that we are all being punished for one dog. 'Now. I have to take a bus and walk for a very long way to collect my mail. It's hard to believe that one dog is affecting all our mail.' But other residents said they too had been chased by the dog. Paul Ogden, 24, of Briar Hill Avenue, said: 'If it's too unsafe for the postmen then what about us? 'We've got kids - surely something should be done about it. It has chased me before. It's a big dog.' Sarah Rouse, 32, said she and her two. children - Chloe, 16, and Lucas, 13 - had all been chased by the dog. She said: 'It needs to be locked up and restrained for everyone's. safety. Royal Mail spokeswoman Val Boden said they were working with the council and hoped to resume deliveries soon.

She said: 'Deliveries have already. been suspended to the address where the dog lives and we have asked the. owners to keep the dog under control, so that the postman can complete. his round safely. 'Unfortunately this hasn't happened. Following a number of near misses and a risk assessment of the area, we have had to temporarily suspend deliveries to these properties as a precautionary measure.' Gena Merrett, Salford's assistant mayor for housing and environment, confirmed they had received a complaint about the dog on Tuesday. The owner of the dog - described as a large dark brown mixed-breed - could not be contacted. The curtains of the house were closed and the dog could be heard barking inside.

Justice sent a letter to SAC, Greenlight, and Soros—among others—the same day the Wall Street Journal reported that they had met at an “idea dinner” during which a trader predicted that the euro would depreciate and pushed other firms to join his in shorting the currency.

              " \"A guard who lost his job after taking a photo during a visit from President Obama has spoken out about being fired - saying it was 'unjust'. Kenneth Tate, 47, a security guard who worked at the CDC headquarters in Atlanta, Georgia, embarrassed the Secret Service and was thrown into a political firestorm last month - but has said all he wanted out of the encounter was a picture to show his 81-year-old mom. He was fired from his $42,000 job after getting too close to the President's security detail during a visit on September 16, and taking a picture of the assembled cars. 'Injustice': Kenneth Tate, 47, said he unfairly lost his job after he took a photograph during a visit by President Obama - and also embarrassed the Secret Service by riding next to him in an elevator while armed. Speaking to the New York Times\\xa0in the wake of the sacking, Tate called the events which lost him his position 'a nightmare' and 'unjust'. He also spoke out about the scandal that erupted when it emerged he was armed during the encounter with Obama - contrary to rules which state that only Secret Service agents can have firearms in the President's presence. The revelation came as an embarrassment to the service, which was still reeling from accusations of incompetence after letting a man armed with a knife hop the White House fence and charge inside. Secret Service Director Julia Pearson resigned soon after. Tate says he was never told to surrender his gun, and was in the elevator because it was his job. He told the Times: 'From the reports, I was some stranger that entered the elevator. I mean, I was appointed.' 'Tarnished': Tate is now unemployed after losing his CDC job, and says his good name has been smeared. Before it emerged the day had cost him his livelihood, Tate said he was proud to have met the President - who shook his hand and asked his name. A Secret Service agent apparently quipped that this was remarkable, as he had never been acknowledged by Obama in two years. But speaking later, he said the day tarnished his reputation. He said: 'It's a nightmare. My whole life's been changed upside-down.' 'How do you go anywhere when it seems like the doors have been closed on you, your reputation tarnished, the embarrassment? Recalling the encounter, he said: 'He [Obama] acknowledged me, he asked me what my name was and extended his hand and shook my hand. 'I was trying to get a picture of them leaving, and I was unsuccessful. 'At the end part I tried to take a picture of them leaving. The motorcade was driving, they were parked, getting ready to leave. 'I tried to get a picture for my mom, she's 81 years old, just to show that I had met the President.

Tate, who is now unemployed, has never been given an official explanation for his sacking. He was not directly employed by the CDC, but worked for a company called Professional Security Corporation. His son, who also worked at the CDC headquarters, also lost his job two weeks later - which the organization blamed on 'downsizing'. A Secret Service source indicated that Tate's account is a fair summary of what happened that day - though an executive at his old company told the Times his description was 'not correct' - but would not elaborate.

              " '– Doubts are now emerging about a harrowing tale of a woman kidnapped, thrown in her trunk, and then murdered. Though police in Montana and Washington initially described Rita Maze\\'s death as a homicide, now they aren\\'t so sure, reports KHQ. At this point, they are ruling out no possibilities, including suicide. In a series of phone calls with police and family members on Tuesday, Maze described a man hitting her on the head and forcing her into the trunk of her 2005 Pontiac Grand Prix at a rest stop in Wolf Creek, Mont. She was found dead of a gunshot to the chest just after midnight Wednesday in Spokane, Wash., about two hours after an officer heard gunshots on the line. A Spokane County sheriff tells the Spokesman-Review that people are right to question Maze\\'s story, though he\\'s not sure \"what is going on.\" Maze\\'s daughter, however, maintains that her mom was abducted. Maze, who was returning from an overnight visit at her daughter\\'s house, was 60 miles from her Great Falls home when she arrived at the rest stop in Wolf Creek. She \"did not hit herself, stuff herself in the trunk, and drive all the way to Spokane and shoot herself,\" Rochelle Maze says. She believes an assailant \"shot her and left the gun and keys in [the car] to make it look like she killed herself.\" Police say Maze\\'s keys were in the ignition, her purse was in the front seat, and blood was found on the ground near a $20 bill.',\n",
              " \"Don't\\xa0expect Barry Geraghty to turn into the green-eyed monster looking at colleague’s rides any time soon – there is no need. Lining up for the 35-year-old Irishman in the coming weeks should be his 2013 Cheltenham Gold Cup winner Bobs Worth, King George VI Chase favourite Simonsig and recuperating 2013 Champion Chase winner Sprinter Sacre. Geraghty also has an enthusiastic eye on future talent. Barry Geraghty wins the\\xa0Doom Bar Sefton Novices Hurdle with Beat That. Geraghty is looking ahead to racing up and coming horses including Beat That and\\xa0Vaniteux. That’s why missing riding Jezki, his Champion Hurdle winner in March, on his return to action against Hurricane Run in Saturday's Morgiana Hurdle at Punchestown and More Of That, his World Hurdle winner, in the Long Distance Hurdle at Newbury later this month, will not spark a hint of a tantrum. Geraghty said: ‘I can’t say I am overly envious of anyone. I got a great ride from More Of That and Jezki last season. They are two horses you’d like to ride but I hope to have two young horses to step up and snap at their heels in Beat That and Vaniteux. ‘Beat That was a frame of a horse last year and did well to win at Punchestown and Aintree. He should improve a lot physically. The hope is that he will be a World Hurdle Hurdle horse. More Of That sets the standard but he should have a shout.’ Geraghty celebrates after winning the Ladbrokes World Hurdle at Chelteham with More Of That. The Irish jockey races to victory on Jetzski at the Champion Hurdle at Cheltenham. Geraghty’s aspirations for Vaniteux, third in the Supreme Novices’ Hurdle in March, will be tested when he carries top weight of 11st 12lb in tomorrow’s Greatwood Hurdle. Geraghty said: ‘Even though he has top weight, his handicap mark is reasonable. He has pace but he doesn’t lack physique – he is very strong.’ Geraghty rides Oscar Whisky for his boss Nicky Henderson in Saturday afternoon’s Paddy Power Gold Cup, a race he won in 2002 on Cyfor Malta. Geraghty (C) leads eventual\\xa0winner Parlour Games to victory at the\\xa0Hyde Novices’ Hurdle. The three-time Grade One winner has not yet matched best hurdles form when chasing but Geraghty feels he knows the key. The rider said: ‘The big thing is to get him into a rhythm jumping. If he does, he has a big chance.’ Geraghty’s Open Meeting got off to a good start on Friday, easily landing the Grade Two Hyde Novices’ Hurdle on John Ferguson-trained 10-1 Parlour Games. The six-year-old, now the same odds to the Neptune Investment Novices’ Hurdle at the Festival in March, showed a classy turn of foot, hardly surprising given he won the 2011 Melrose Stakes at York and his dam is 2000 Irish Oaks winner Petrushka. BHA and Cheltenham will not change the start time of the Paddy Power Gold Cup, despite fears it could be disrupted by low sunlight. Only 10 of the 16 obstacles were jumped in Friday's novices’ chase won by Champagne West which started at 2.25pm. Today’s race is off at 2.30pm. Spokesman Robin Mounsey said the chance of a problem was ‘low risk’ but BHA will hope to avoid an embarrassing hat-trick. Two weeks ago the Charlie Hall Chase at Wetherby was run over the wrong distance. Last week’s Badger Beer Chase at Wincanton was ‘won’ by ineligible entry The Young Master, subsequently disqualified.\",\n",

The agreements provide Enron access to Huntco\\'s network of steel distribution centers nationwide. The agreements also provide for Enron\\'s acquisition of Huntco\\'s cold rolling and certain coil pickling operations in Blytheville, Arkansas. These transactions with Huntco have the potential to fundamentally change the way steel is bought and sold in the United States. It gives Enron immediate access to physical steel and positions Enron geographically to serve the steel industry in a variety of ways. In addition to providing physical products on both a spot and term basis, EIM\\'s goals for the steel industry include developing commodity risk management products, providing structured finance products and establishing the market-making capabilities that Enron has brought to the natural gas, power and other commodity markets. Enron North America-Upstream Products Upstream Products has partnered with Duke Energy Field Services (DEFS) to close a 20-year NGL exchange and transportation deal with Formosa Hydrocarbons and Williams Energy Field Services to handle raw make product from the Williams Markham plant. Formosa Hydrocarbons is building a 40,000 BPD fractionator to handle this and other Gulf Coast NGL production. The accompanying pipeline will be known as the Seabreeze pipeline system and will be constructed by DEFS. Texas Brine LLC will provide NGL storage services for Formosa Hydrocarbons on this system. Primary production for this system is coming from the Boomvang Nansen field in the deepwater GOM and will be the first deepwater GOM production to come onshore in Texas. Upstream Products has also worked to arrange a 20-year transportation lease agreement on the Dean Pipeline (owned by TEPPCO) for refinery grade propylene service to be utilized by Formosa Plastics. Coupled with this transaction, Enron Clean Fuels has entered into a propylene storage agreement with Formosa Plastics to utilize ECF\\'s Mt. Belvieu storage facilities. In addition, Enron Global Markets has been able to amend its current transportation agreement with TEPPCO to prematurely terminate a take-or-pay obligation and realize additional transportation revenues from interim NGL production coming from the Williams Markham to be delivered to Mt. Belvieu. Upon close, Upstream Products was monetized out of its initial position by DEFS and retained a risk-free net profits position on the Seabreeze Pipeline going forward for an additional 20,000-40,000 BPD of excess capacity on the system.

              " \"A HIV+ nurse was sentenced  to three years in jail today for criminal negligence after she pricked herself with a needle before injecting a child. Rosemary Namubiru, 64, was convicted for using a intravenous needle on the child after pricking herself - a decision slammed as 'deeply flawed' by HIV/AIDS campaigners. Throughout her trial, the nurse maintained she was not acting in malice and the incident was an accident. Two tests have shown the child was not infected with HIV, according to court records. Ugandan nurse Rosemary Namubiru sits at the dock at the Buganda Road Magistrates Court today where she was sentenced to three years in jail for criminal negligence. Scores of international activist groups. rallied around the nurse - saying she was the victim of stigma and. discrimination because of her HIV status and should not face trial. Despite their support, she was found guilty of criminal negligence for allegedly in court today and sentenced to three years behind bars. In November last year all direct aid was cut following a corruption scandal in the country. However, it will still receive £97.9million in aid from the UK this year, The Department for International Development said. A DFID spokesperson said: 'We ended direct payments to the Ugandan government last year.' According to the Overseas Development Institute, the country received $1.6bn (£960m) in total from western countries in 2011, making it the world's 20th largest aid recipient. Following the incident in January this year, the nurse was later denied bail in a controversial decision by a magistrate who ruled that she posed a danger to the public. International activists rallied behind the nurse - claiming she was charged and convicted because she had HIV. The nurse was charged under a colonial-era law against negligence that. spreads a deadly disease. However, since she was charged Ugandan lawmakers have passed a law. specifically criminalizing the intentional transmission of HIV as part. of the government's efforts to stem the growing rate of HIV in this East. African country. That measure also has been criticised by groups that. say such a law will be difficult to enforce and may also be used to. violate the rights of people living with HIV. Some organisations said her trial was unwarranted and she should only have faced disciplinary action from the local nurses' association. Asia Russell from the Global Access Project said: 'The. deeply flawed ruling shows that stigma and discrimination against. people with HIV is alive and well in Uganda. 'Because of her HIV. status, Rosemary's trial was plagued from the beginning with bias. Rosemary never had the presumption of innocence the Constitution. guarantees.' Many Ugandans, however, see her case as a shocking example of malice or negligence by a trusted medical worker. Namubiru's arrest was widely covered in the Ugandan press, with some dubbing her the 'killer nurse' - a description that some activists said violated her right to a fair trial. According to the most recent survey by Uganda's Ministry of Health, 7.3 percent of the Ugandan population has HIV - up from about 6 percent a decade ago. At least 60 countries criminalize the transmission of HIV or the failure to disclose one's HIV status to sex partners, according to AIDS-Free World.\",\n",

              " 'Socialization is the process of introducing a puppy to new situations so he learns to interact properly. Introducing your puppy to new situations and people teaches him that the right things (such as other friendly dogs, cats, and people) are not to be feared. Fearful dogs can become “aggressive” if they bite and bark when they cannot run away from the situation. Running away from things that should not be feared can be dangerous. Dogs can run into traffic and get hit by vehicles or run away from home and get lost. Once he\\'s current with vaccinations, you can take him to parks, for walks along busy streets, other dog-friendly places, or enroll him in obedience school. If there are no obedience classes in your area or if you are waiting for one to start up, you can start on basic commands and socialization. You can also take him to crowded areas so he can watch new people and things.  You should try exposing your dog to as many different things as possible. For example, take him for a short car ride and stop every once in a while to let him check out his surroundings. Or, invite friends and their pets over to meet your dog. Let him interact with all different types of people and animals. Don\\'t force or rush your dog to socialize. If he\\'s fearful around new animals, don\\'t constantly make him interact. Instead, take it slow and move at a pace that\\'s clearly comfortable for him. If you do, your Jack Russell will learn to be nervous and aggressive with other dogs. Instead, try to keep him on his leash and keep him beside you when other dogs approach. If a stray or aggressive-looking dog comes up, leave the area quickly with your Jack Russell in tow. On the other hand, Jack Russells can be overly aggressive towards other dogs, even other Jack Russells. Since Jack Russell Terriers are hunting dogs, it\\'s in their nature to be aggressive. You should never leave your dog unattended with another dog, even another Jack Russell Terrier. For this reason, you shouldn\\'t have a Jack Russell Terrier around small children, small animals or pets, or cats. To curb some of your dog\\'s aggression, keep him well exercised and active. Bored Jack Russell Terriers are more likely to be aggressive or destructive. Since your Jack Russell may think he\\'s the top dog, let him know that you are the master. For example, after he\\'s learned the sit command, make your Jack Russell sit for his food before you let him eat it. Be firm and consistent with him. Don\\'t just let him do whatever he wants. You can take him for a long walk or play active games. Jack Russells are very smart and will keep you hopping unless they can find an outlet for all their pent-up energy. Playing active games such as fetch will help burn off their excessive energy. Terriers love this game. Jack Russells love when you chase them for the toy. Don\\'t make this a habit, or your dog will learn not to come to you when you call him. Instead, teach him the \"drop it\" command. This way, you\\'re still in charge of the game. These can help burn your Jack Russell\\'s energy. Kongs are great toys because they\\'re almost impossible to tear apart. You can pack them full of peanut butter and treats to keep you Jack Russell busy and working for his snacks. Generally, stuffed toys aren\\'t great for terriers, even though they love them. Your Jack Russell will probably tear it apart and try to eat it piece by piece leaving your home covered in stuffing. Choose a high-quality dog food that isn\\'t filled with grains or preservatives. Instead, look for a dog food that lists meat, such as lamb or chicken, as a top ingredient. Since dog food products vary, follow the specific feeding instructions on the package. You\\'ll probably also need to adjust the amount food you give your Jack Russell Terrier based on his age, activity level, and size. As a general guideline, a 12 inch Jack Russell Terrier should weigh around 12 to 13 pounds.',\n",

              " \"Most New Yorkers don't even know it exists, but a million forgotten souls are buried in mass graves dug by convicts on a tiny, forbidden island east of the Bronx. Since 1869, still born babies, the homeless, the poor and the unclaimed have been stacked one upon the other, three coffins deep, on Hart Island. Corpses are interred in great, anonymous trenches. There are no tombstones. Small white posts in the ground mark each 150 adult bodies. A thousand children and infants are buried together per grave. It is one of the largest cemeteries in the United States. And the least visited. Forbidden: Access to Hart Island and its decaying abandoned prison workhouse is severely restricted. Each white plastic pipe near the building marks an infant mass gravesite, one plastic pipe per 1,000 babies. Mass grave: A sailboat passes behind an abandoned building on Hart Island, east of the Bronx. The men doing the digging are convicts from Rikers Island, petty offenders tasked with carrying bodies to their final resting place. Nearly 1,500 fresh corpses arrive each year, says visual artist Melinda Hunt, who heads the Hart Island Project, which campaigns to make the cemetery visible and accessible. The authorities say nearly a million people have been buried here since 1869. It is forbidden to film and photograph the uninhabited, windswept island. Visits must be authorized by the Department of Corrections, which runs the island. First used as a cemetery in the Civil War, Hart Island has variously served as a training camp, a prison for captured Confederates, a workhouse, a mental asylum and even a Cold War missile base. The only jetty is closed to the public, hemmed in by railings, barbed wire and spikes. Notice boards warn people to keep out. Locked out: Hart Island is run by the department of corrections and access is nearly impossible. Waiting game: Laurie Grant (pictured), doctor who gave birth to a still-born daughter in 1993, has been waiting for years to gain access to the restricted Hart Island. For years, records of who's been buried where have been patchy and negotiating access has proved challenging. Some have been lost, others burned. Families sometimes cannot even find out if their loved ones were buried by the city. 'You have a right to know where a person is. It's very important not to disappear people. It's not an acceptable thing to do in any culture,'Hunt said. The Department of Corrections says it doesn't have the infrastructure to welcome visitors on an island where the buildings are dilapidated and abandoned. Under pressure, however, the authorities have allowed a few visits since 2007, albeit within a gazebo far from the graves. City limits: Just within the boundaries of the Bronx, Hart Island is tucked away from the view of most people. 'You don't see anything,' said Elaine Joseph, a 59-year-old nurse whose baby daughter died at five days old in 1978. 'They check your ID, and ask you to hand over your cell phone, any electronic equipment and they put it in an envelope and lock it and then you get to the island, they ask for your ID again. They treat you as a visitor of an inmate.' In November, a small group of women who threatened to bring a complaint were given permission to visit specific grave sites. Joseph became the first to go on March 14. Once there, she broke down in tears. 'I. can't say I found closure. When you lose a child, there really is never. closure. There is a piece of you that is gone,' she said. 'I did find solace in that there was water surrounding it and there was a lovely view.' She was even allowed to take a photograph. Long history: Inmates of now-derelict Hart Island Prison bury bodies of people poisoned by wood alcohol. Trench: This photo from 1990 shows a mass burial trench for adults. Pine boxes used as coffins can be seen. Laurie Grant, a 61-year-old doctor who gave birth to a still-born daughter in 1993, hopes to be the next. But on March 28, she waited in vain in the rain on the jetty. Due to unwillingness or miscommunication, those who were supposed to ferry her across the water left before she even arrived. Over the years, Hunt said she has lost track of all the families she has tried to help, though estimates the number is at least 500. Most were Americans, but there have been others from France, the Netherlands and Poland, and one Irish woman looking for a grandfather.

However this past weekend we met one of the worse wattress in fine dining. Her name was Keren. A few points about Keren  1. Rushed us to order 2. Never smiled  3. Checked on us only once during the meal 4. Everyone in the restaurant received their amuse bouche except us (our bill even listed it came with the meal but we never received it) 5. Our food took a long time and she never once came by during the time we waited to reassure us it was coming out or was apologetic. 6. No smile, I didn't feel welcomed   On to the food. We ordered the braised short ribs and the veal. The short ribs were excellent, came with knocchi on the bottom, very well portions. With the veal, I would skip it. Maybe I'm not a veal eater but it reminds me of pork chops. Overall, I think the wattress really left a bad taste in my mouth so my appetite was not well.\",\n",

              " 'The bodies of two French journalists, who were killed in Mali, arrived in France Tuesday, Radio France International reported. Ghislaine Dupont and Claude Verlon worked for Radio France International and were kidnapped Saturday morning. The abduction occurred after the journalists were interviewing a Tuareg rebel near the northern town of Kidal, a local governor said, according to RFI sister network France Info. Both were kidnapped by four men in a Toyota, said Gov. Adama Kamissoko of Kidal. Kidal was one of the strongholds of the Islamic militant Tuareg uprising last year that plunged Mali into chaos after a military-led coup. Following the coup, Tuareg rebels occupied the northern half of the country. Veteran Spanish war correspondent kidnapped in Syria. As part of France\\'s intervention this year to flush out militants in Mali, the French military secured the area around Kidal. The two reporters were abducted in front of the home of a member of the Tuareg rebels\\' National Movement of a Liberation of Azawad, RFI reported. The two journalists could be heard resisting their abduction, according to their driver, who was forced by the gunmen to lay on the ground, RFI said. French President Francois Hollande called an emergency meeting with ministers Sunday about the incident. Hollande condemned the killings, calling them \"despicable.\" The kidnappings and deaths came the same week four French hostages were released. They were abducted in 2010 by al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb in neighboring Niger. Italian journalist held captive in Syria is headed home.',\n",

I ended up getting a free $5 wash.  So when you think about it....that's 2 washes for $12 (1 premium wash and 1 basic...not too shabby if you ask me).  I took J's car to get washed with the free wash Tuesday and then took my 16 year old truck for a $5 wash last night.  The old boy looked great after wards!    I have to admit, I like this wash better than the one around the corner, though they towel dry your vehicle.  I'd rather come to Clean Freak just for the pure fact that for the same price, you can get to vacuum out your vehicle, can air blast off excess water (which there will after going through the dryers), and you get a detail towel to wipe down your dash.    Bring a towel with you to dry off your vehicle when you're in the vacuum area.

Yet he\\'s just been schooled by a relative newbie. Google\\'s 2-year-old computer program AlphaGo, built at artificial intelligence lab DeepMind, defeated Sedol, 33, in the first of five scheduled matches in Seoul on Wednesday, leaving him \"in shock,\" reports NBC News. Though Go has long been thought too complicated for a computer to learn—\"it is primarily a game about intuition rather than brute-force calculation used in chess,\" DeepMind\\'s CEO explains—AlphaGo uses reinforcement learning. It studied 100,000 matches, then learned to look for the best moves, reports NPR. It defeated the 633rd-ranked Go player in October and has improved by playing millions of games against itself. Throughout the 3.5-hour match Wednesday, viewers were impressed to see AlphaGo playing much like a human, per Wired. The computer matched Sedol\\'s pace and often moved on the offensive. It also moved to reinforce weak groups of stones, just as a top player would, says AlphaGo\\'s operator, who physically moved the game pieces. At the same time, AlphaGo made moves \"that could not have been possible for human being to choose,\" Sedol says. Despite the loss, humans shouldn\\'t fear a future of robot overlords, Eric Schmidt of Alphabet (formerly Google) tells ZDNet. \"As artificial intelligence and machine learning develop further, each and every person will become smarter and more talented.\" A second match is set for Thursday.',\n",

              " \"When a U.S. Air Force fighter jet crashed Monday during a mission over Libya, it quickly set off a chain of events on four continents involving at least nine aircraft and a platoon of Marines. The F-15E Strike Eagle, which is normally based in Britain, had taken off with another F-15E from the U.S. air base in Aviano, Italy. The aircraft were on a mission to attack Libyan air defense systems. According to timelines released by the U.S. Marines and the White House, at about 11:30 p.m. (5:30 p.m. ET) Monday, one of the F-15s crashed east of Benghazi, in the heart of rebel-held territory. Adm. Samuel Locklear III, commander of the Operation Odyssey Dawn Joint Task Force, said the crash was the result of equipment malfunction, and early reports indicated that hostile fire was not involved. Both the pilot and the weapons systems officer ejected safely from the plane and suffered only minor injuries, according to Locklear. But they were separated as they parachuted. The two crew members remained in communications with the other fighter jet crew, who in turn communicated back to coalition commanders. By 12:50 a.m. Tuesday, two Marine Corps AV-8B Harriers took off from the USS Kearsarge, an amphibious assault ship about 100 miles away in the Mediterranean Sea, to assist in the rescue. Five minutes later the commander overseeing the Joint Task Force air operations approved a Marine Corps Tactical Recovery of Aircraft and Personnel (TARP) mission from the USS Kearsarge. As the unit prepared to launch from the ship, at about 1:20 a.m., two Marine Harrier jets arrived over the crash site and established communications through the crew of an F-16 fighter jet that also is in contact with the downed crew. At about the same time, a KC-130 tanker took off from an air base at Sigonella, Sicily, in case the Harriers or other aircraft needed to refuel in midair during the rescue mission. An hour after the crash (6:30 p.m. ET Monday), Adm. Michael Mullen, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in Washington informs the National Security Adviser Tom Donilon. Fifteen minutes later, President Barack Obama, who was in Chile, was told. At 1:33 a.m. Tuesday (Libya time), 13 minutes after the Harriers arrived over the crash scene -- the F15E pilot saw a crowd moving toward him. The Harriers dropped two 500-pound laser-guided bombs between the pilot and the crowd. At least five Libyans in the crowd were injured by shrapnel. Back on the USS Kearsarge, two MV-22 Ospreys took off. The tilt-rotor planes take off and land like helicopters but fly as fast as airplanes. At about 1:51 a.m., two CH-53 Sea Stallion helicopters launch carrying a quick-reaction force, a platoon of Marines ready to hit the ground and help rescue the pilot if needed. It took the Ospreys nearly 45 minutes to fly to the crash site. At 2:38 a.m., one of the Ospreys landed and the pilot was rescued. The Osprey landed back on the USS Kearsarge at 3 a.m. and the pilot walked off the aircraft. The platoon of Marines wasn't needed. As the pilot was being rescued, the weapons systems officer was found by Libyan anti-Gadhafi rebels. They took him to a safe place in a hotel. At 9 p.m. EST, Obama was told that both crew members were safe. However, it would be 20 hours before sources in the Department of Defense confirmed that the weapons systems officer was out of Libya and somewhere in Europe. There still is no word on where he was hidden, who got him out of Libya or where in Europe he is. As of 7 p.m. ET Tuesday, the Department of Defense had not released the name of either airman or the exact cause of the crash. All told, at least nine U.S. aircraft, not counting whatever plane flew the WSO to Europe, were involved in the rescue. Meanwhile, U.S. and coalition airstrikes continue in Libya. So far, 336 air missions have been flown, including 108 strikes against Libyan military targets, since Friday.\",\n",

Executive: City boss Matt Pullen has quit CBRE after being arrested on suspicion of rape after a work event. A City high-flyer with the world's biggest property agent has stepped down after being arrested on suspicion of rape - just two months before he was due to take over as managing director. Millionaire Matt Pullen has resigned from his senior executive role at CBRE London after an alleged sex attack at the five-star Grange Hotel in the capital. The 44-year-old is married and lives with his wife in a £1million converted barn in Westerham, Kent, and had been with the company for 20 years until his sudden departure last week. It is understood that Mr Pullen had attended an afternoon work event with a woman, and later that evening the City of London Police were called to the hotel close to St Paul's Cathedral, and he was arrested on suspicion of rape. 'A man, aged 44, was arrested by. City of London Police on Wednesday, October 31, on suspicion of rape. He has subsequently been bailed pending further inquiries,' a City of London Police spokesman said. Mr Pullen has not been formally charged and is bailed until February next year. CBRE, which is based in Los Angeles, employs 34,000 around the world and has a turnover of £4.4billion, confirmed that he has left the company. 'Mr Pullen is no longer an employee of CBRE. We can confirm that. the matter is now the subject of a police investigation with which CBRE. will fully co-operate. It is now a private matter for the individual. involved,' a spokesman said. He was due to start running the UK operation on January 1, but now Ciaran Bird, head of CBRE’s UK retail division, has been promoted in his place. Claim: Pullen had been at The Grange St Paul's Hotel following an afternoon work event, it is understood. Mr Pullen joined the company as a graduate in 1990 before taking over a role vacated by rugby stars Rob Andrew and Gavin Hastings. He also gave an interview to the company's website where he said he had no intention on leaving because it offered such wonderful career progression. He also praised the social part of the job and the business since he joined in his twenties. Detained: Mr Pullen was held at the exclusive Grange Hotel (pictured), and has since left his job after 20 years. 'It was really social. The balance of work and play was fantastic. I think it's still like that now.' He went on: 'The beauty of the company is it leaves you to determine how to handle work and life.' Mr Pullen rose up the ranks at at CBRE, making a name for himself in its global corporate services division, where he acted for giants like Nokia, Barclays and HSBC. There was no response at his Kent home last night. Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.\",\n",
              " 'If you want water that glows in different colors (instead of the yellow that is produced by almost all other methods), buy paint in different shades. Try blue, red, and yellow, which you can mix up to create more shades.  Glow-in-the-dark paints will glow without the presence of a blacklight--they can be charged by exposure to regular light. The fluorescent paints will only respond to the UV rays from a blacklight. Look for paints that are designed for kids and are 100% non-toxic. Using clear glasses or bottles will allow your glowing fluid to be bright and visible. Using hot water will dilute the paint faster, so you will see faster results.

If you are using glow-in-the-dark paint, check the instructions on how to \"charge\" them so they glow. Usually you need to expose the paint to sunlight for several minutes before it will glow.

Witnesses say a British man was killed during a bad trip after consuming a hallucinogenic brew at Phoenix Ayahuasca, which the Independent calls \"an alternative health center.\" Authorities say Canadian Joshua Andrew Freeman Stevens, 29, killed Brit Unais Gomes, 26, in self-defense after Gomes allegedly grabbed a kitchen knife and attacked him as the two took part in an ayahuasca ceremony, per Reuters. Ayahuasca—made from the ayahuasca vine and the shrub chacruna, per the BBC—contains the active ingredient dimethyltryptamine and is illegal in many countries, including the US and UK.

The proposal to relocate the five-time Super Bowl champions from the city where they\\'ve played their games since 1946 calls for public funds to subsidize about 8 percent of the project\\'s costs, while having the team pay the city at least $1 million in rent a year on average for 40 years, plus millions more based on a cut of stadium revenue.  The plan calls for the city to contribute $42 million from redevelopment funds, plus $20 million to move an electricity station at the proposed stadium site - one of two city-owned parking lots currently leased to the Great America theme park.  The city portion also includes $17 million as part of the cost of building a parking garage at the site, although that money had already been raised because the garage was originally designed to serve the Santa Clara Convention Center across the street.  \"What I\\'m really excited about this deal is it takes redevelopment money and turns it into general fund money,\" said City Councilman Kevin Moore, a leading proponent of trying to get the stadium.',\n",

Overlap them to create a circlet, then secure them with bobby pins.  Add gentle waves to your hair with a curling iron for a romantic touch. Pin the left braid down first, then cross the right braid over it and pin it down too. This will make your circlet seamless. Gather a section of hair from each temple and twist them upwards to make ropes. Pull the ropes back into a half-up ponytail, then secure them with an elastic. Weave the ponytail into a fishtail braid, then tie it off with a clear elastic. Cut the elastic at the top of your half-up ponytail off.  The sections should start at the edge of your forehead and finish at your sideburns, right in front of your ears. Make them about 1 inch (2.5\\xa0cm) thick. Add some curls or waves into your hair for a romantic, relaxed look. Create a deep side part, then do a French braid for 2 to 3 inches (5.1 to 7.6\\xa0cm) on the thicker side. Continue with a waterfall braid along the side, back, and other side of your head. Once you reach your opposite temple, secure the braid with 1 or 2 bobby pins.

Pull it across your forehead and bobby pin it behind your ear.  You can make your headband braid thick or thin, depending on your preference. Similarly, you can do a simple braid, or you can try a fishtail style. For a sleek touch, do a small, tight braid and straighten your hair. This looks great on bobs.

Secure the braid with an elastic when it's long enough to reach the back of your ear; leave the rest of the hair section out of the braid. Gather your hair into a half-up ponytail at eyebrow level. Create 2 small braids using the hair from your temples, wrap them towards the back of your head, and bobby pin them to the ponytail. Use the hair from the ponytail to create a pull-through braid.  Bobby pin the right braid to the left side of the ponytail, and the left braid to the right side. This will look neater. Add gentle waves to the rest of your hair for a fluffy look.

Donors will have a say in its direction, including what articles will appear. \"It was when Kellyanne Conway said \\'alternative facts\\' and I was just like \\'f--- it ... we have to do something about this,\" Wales tells Wired. The site uses the Wikipedia model, displaying sources—meaning \"you can make up your own mind,\" without facts that are tainted by bias, taken out of context, or \"just plain … made-up,\" per the site. Wales tells the Guardian that Wikipedia itself is \"not a perfect place,\" but he adds it also hasn\\'t been overrun by fake news. \"If there is any kryptonite to false information, it\\'s transparency,\" Wales recently wrote in the Guardian. A Dutch site has ventured into similar crowdsourcing.

              " 'A lesbian athletic director fired a popular male gym teacher who was married with kids because she disapproved of his traditional family status, he has claimed. Gregory Kenney, 51, taught gym at Trinity School, an exclusive private school in Manhattan\\'s Upper West Side, for 16 years before he was sacked in 2012. The father-of-three claims in a lawsuit that the athletic director, Pat Krieger, took a disliking to him for being straight when she arrived in 2009 and treated the young, single women employees far better. Krieger allegedly made Kenney coach three sports, even though his contract required him to coach two, and when he complained about it, she was unsympathetic, according to his suit. Lawsuit: Pat Krieger, left, the sports director at Trinity School in Manhattan and a lesbian, allegedly helped fire Gregory Kenney, right, because she disapproved of his traditional family status and commitments. After Kenney told Krieger that he couldn\\'t working extra, she reported him to the headmaster but when a young, single female teacher had the same complaints, she accommodated her, the suit said. He claims she \\'routinely favored other single, younger females without children and discriminated against [him] because of his gender, sexual orientation, \"traditional family status\" and age\\'. \\'I love the school. I love my job. I enjoyed the kids I was with and the classes I taught, but I have a wife and family. I\\'m not 16,\\' Kenney told the New York Daily News. \\'He felt ostracized because of his family,\\' Kenney\\'s attorney, Steven Morelli, told The New York Post. Kenney, who coached soccer, basketball and golf at Trinity, added that on at least one occasion he was dissuaded from going to school events \\'because he was a heterosexual, married male with children, who wouldn\\'t fit in with [Krieger\\'s] \"culture\",\\' the Post reported. Ostracized: When Kenney complained that extra work conflicted with time with his wife Suzanne, right, and their children, Krieger allegedly gave him no sympathy - whereas she went easier on younger, female staff. Then he claimed Krieger\\'s attack became even more personal when she accused him of illegally subletting his Trinity Tower apartment and leaving students unsupervised, the suit says. He claims that her accusations were false. \\'It was very stressful and difficult,\\' Kenney told the Daily News. He was fired as a result and said that three other married coaches with children also lost their jobs. Kenney and his wife, who is also a gym teacher, complained to school officials about his treatment but nothing was done, he said. School: He had worked at the exclusive Upper West Side school for 16 years before being fired. After losing the job, Kenney, who has seven-year-old twin girls and a nine-year-old son, was replaced by a lesbian teacher, according to court papers. He is seeking unspecified damages in the suit. A spokesman for Trinity did not immediately comment. The school, which was founded 300 years ago and costs parents as much as $41,000 a year per student, counts Truman Capote, Ivanka Trump and John McEnroe among its alumni.',\n",

Credit: DrMikeBaxter/Wikipedia (Phys.org)—A quartet of researchers at Simon Fraser University in Canada has found evidence that suggests that the reason early humans were able to survive the ice age while the Neanderthal perished is because humans figured out how to make parka-like clothing to keep warm and Neanderthals did not. In a paper published in Journal of Anthropological Archaeology, Mark Collard, Lia Tarle, Dennis Sandgathe and Alexander Allan describe their study of camp site evidence from both groups and offer some ideas on why just one group was able to survive. \\n  \\n As scientists continue to explore why humans managed to survive to the modern age while other hominids did not, new evidence has emerged that suggests at least one of them: Neanderthals might have perished because they were not able to sufficiently warm themselves using animal fur. \\n  \\n The study consisted of analyzing data describing campsites used by early humans and Neanderthals and then comparing the two to find similarities or differences. One major difference they noted was the lack of the type of animal remains around Neanderthal sites that would have suggested they were used to make warm clothes. In sharp contrast, the researchers found multiple examples of animals such as fox, rabbit, or mink—and particularly Wolverine—remains around 56 early human campfires, all of which could have been skinned to allow for use in creating a fur coat or parka. The finding of Wolverine remains was of particular note because it is the same animal that people living in the Arctic in modern times turn to keep warm because it works so well as a liner and fringe around the hood. \\n  \\n Reconstruction of Neanderthal man. Credit: public domain \\n  \\n The researchers also note that other evidence of humans crafting warm clothes has been found as well, such as bone needles for sewing and other tools that could be used to scrape pelts. Also, a set of figurines wearing parka-like coats and dating back approximately 24,000 years was found in Siberia. No such evidence of Neanderthals wearing crafted clothes has ever been found. \\n  \\n As to why the Neanderthals would not have crafted clothes to survive the cold, the researchers suggest they may have lacked the intelligence or simply because their cultural traditions were standing in the way. \\n  \\n Explore further: Analysis of bones found in Romania offer evidence of human and Neanderthal interbreeding in Europe \\n  \\n More information: Faunal evidence for a difference in clothing use between Neanderthals and early modern humans in Europe, Journal of Anthropological Archaeology, In Press, DOI: 10.1016/j.jaa.2016.07.010 , http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0278416516300757 \\n  \\n  |||||',\n",

              " \"They provide one of the great intrigues of the human race. For centuries scientists and psychologists have attempted to unravel the mysteries of twins and how siblings who share almost identical genetic make-ups can often be so different. Now a landmark project by National Geographic - using both photography and science - has attempted to shed some light on our fascination with twins. Beautiful image: Six-year-olds Johanna and Eva Gill are just two of many subjects photographed for a National Geographic feature on the differences and similarities between twins. Scientists are intrigued by twins as they share an almost-identical genetic code, leaving. differences between them down to environmental factors such as how many. hours of sun they get. Photogenic six-year-olds Johanna and Eva Gill are. just two of many subjects portrayed in the National Geographic. feature. Martin. Schoeller, of New York, took the charming photo of the Gill girls, who. both have mild autism, in which Johanna is seen putting a protective. hand on Eva. ‘It's. very clear when you look at twins that much of what they share is. hardwired,’ researcher Danielle Reed told National Geographic. ‘Many. things about them are absolutely the same. ‘But it's also clear, when you get to know them, that other things about them are different.’ Stars: The tennis duo Mike and Bob Bryan have won more than 70 championships between them, including a title at the Wimbledon Championships in London earlier this year. Another set of twins featured in the National Geographic study are Don and Dave Wolf, of Fenton, Michigan, who have been truck-driving partners for 18 years. ‘We're. wired the same,’ Don Wolf, 53, said. ‘He's messier than I am. But we. like the same music and share the same sense of humour.’ The brothers have driven more than three million miles together. 'We're. wired the same. He's messier than I am. But we. like the same music and share the same sense of humour' Don Wolf on Dave Wolf. The National Geographic study is the latest scientific exploration into the world of twins. One of the most famous studies was the 'Minnesota Twin Family Study' led by David Lykken, which. looked at 65 pairs of twins separated in infancy from the 1970s. It. showed that almost every psychological trait is mostly down to. genetics. But as long ago as 1875, British scientist Sir Francis Galton. had made a similar observation. A whole century on, University of Minnesota psychologist Thomas Bouchard Jr performed a study on twins' intelligence beginning in the 1970s that ruffled many feathers in the scientific community. It helped him conclude that IQ differences are largely down to inheritance - not education. This was a controversial view as experts had said for decades that intelligence was taught and not hereditary. On the road: Don and Dave Wolf, of Fenton, Michigan, have been truck-driving partners for 18 years and driven more than three million miles together. Other examples of twins that have captured the public's attention include Jennifer and. June Gibbons. The troubled teenage Gibbons twins became known for their 11-year sentences at Broadmoor. psychiatric hospital in Berkshire, England, for arson. Jennifer died. aged 30 in 1993. Twins are born with an almost-identical genetic code, but can still have surprising physical or psychological differences that mean they lead wildly different lives. For example, one can be left-handed and the other right - as in the Bryan champion tennis brothers. Or one can adapt better to unusual social situations than the other. But many decide to lead similar lives and even make something of the fact they are twins to help propel them to stardom - such as actors Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen. Scientists say twins often develop much closer bonds than fraternal brothers and sisters, which was shown by the notorious delinquent Gibbons twins' secret language. But it. was before their psychiatric sentence that they were most interesting to. psychologists, as they developed a secret language and communication system, which appeared to be almost telepathic. Another example emerged 10 years ago when almost 3,000 people were killed in. the attacks on 9/11 - and 46 of them were twins. Greg Hoffman thought. about committing suicide after losing his twin brother Stephen in the. New York attack. New York City firefighter Zachary Fletcher, 47, arrived at the World Trade Center scene shortly before the south tower fell and had seen his twin Andre’s fire engine going ahead of him. 'I said: “I love you”,' said Zachary. 'He said: “I love you too, bro”. You know, the weird thing about it is why did I say: “I love you”? I rarely told my brother I loved him. I mean, because we knew it. It was just something you knew.’ Meanwhile even today it was reported that the. twin sister of the beautiful model who lost her hand and left eye in a. plane accident in Plano, Texas, believes she can literally feel her sister's pain, according to her mother. Lauren. Scruggs had a horrific accident earlier this month when she. collided with a plane propeller. Famous twins: Actresses Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen, left, are fraternal twins but their similar looks have helped them make a tidy fortune. Identical Olympic rowers Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss are pictured right. Identical: James, left, and Oliver Phelps played Fred and George Weasley in the Harry Potter films. Many twins gather for the. Twins Days Festival, which takes place every August in Twinsburg, Ohio. The town was named by identical twin brothers almost 200 years ago. Startling images: National Geographic's January 2012 issue. Scientists go to the event to. learn more about twins, and at this year’s festival there was a tent. sponsored by the FBI and two universities, which used face-recognition. software to tell apart twins. Other. researchers wanted to know if twins react differently to alcohol, reported National Geographic. Researchers. also believe that disease must be at least somewhat hereditary if. identical twins are more vulnerable to an illness than fraternal twins. Jodi Cobb, of Washington D.C., also. took a number of photos for the National Geographic project - including. one of the number one doubles team Mike and Bob Bryan. The tennis duo have won more than 70. championships between them, including a title at the Wimbledon. Championships in London earlier this year. The. 33-year-olds, who live in Wesley Chapel, Florida, are so good at. predicting each other’s movements that some opponents joke that they. must be telepathic. Bob measures 6’4” and weight 202lbs, while his brother comes in slightly lower at 6’3” and 192lbs.

The fragmented skull was scanned, with the digital information providing a virtual model from which to fashion a three-dimensional replica.\\nThe Starving Time was one of the most horrific periods of early colonial history. The James Fort settlers were under siege from the indigenous Indian population and had insufficient food to last the winter.\\nFirst they ate their horses, then dogs, cats, rats, mice and snakes. Some, to satisfy their cruel hunger, ate the leather of their shoes.\\nAs the weeks turned to months, nothing was spared to maintain life. How many of the growing numbers of dead were cannibalised is unknown. But it is almost certain the girl was not the only victim.\\nRelief came in the form of Lord De La Warr,  who sailed into the settlement with food and new colonists. After six months of siege and starvation, only 60 of the original 300 settlers had survived.\\n\"It\\'s somebody doing what they had to do,\" said Dr Owsley of the cannibalism.',\n",

              " \"The judge in the divorce case between New York City banker Sage Kelly and his ex-wife Christina has called their trial a 'fiasco.' Justice Matthew Cooper said that the pair's behavior was 'horrible,' and that he felt bad for their 'innocent children.' This as Sage Kelly, a $7 million-a-year Manhattan banker who worked at Jefferies & Co., recently settled with his wife Christina for an undisclosed amount of money. The settlement also includes joint custody of the couples two daughters, 10-year-old Cameron and 6-year-old Logan. Moving on: Sage Kelly has settled his divorce with wife Christina (above with their two daughters) out of court for a very pricey, and undisclosed, sum. Reunited: As past of the settlement agreement, the couple will share joint custody of their two daughters (above) 'This ended up as horrible as it can be for Mr. Kelly and I guess to some extent for Ms. Kelly, but most of all for the children,' Cooper said, according to the New York Post. Sage's lifestyle became very public knowledge in October when Christina’s 26-page affidavit in their divorce was made public, which described in detail her husband's alleged cocaine use and sexual hijinks. At one point Christina, 39, graphically detailed a cocaine-fueled foursome she and Sage had with the head of\\xa0Aegerion Pharmaceuticals, Marc Beer, and his girlfriend at the Ritz-Carlton in Boston. Christina said Sage wanted her involved to get Beer's business for his company, and that she engaged with both Beer and his girlfriend in sexual activity. Battling spouses: Christina counter-sued Sage in August of this year after he won full custody of their daughters when he filmed her doing cocaine in the Manhattan apartment. Revenge affidavit: Christina filed a 26-page affidavit accusing her husband of sexual promiscuity and rampant drug use. Getting dragged in: Christina claimed she and Sage had a cocaine-fuled foursome with pharemcutical big wig Marc Beer (left) and his girlfriend, and that Sage's boss at Jefferies, Ben Lorello (right), used cocaine. In her affidavit Christina also claims that Sage slept with the wife of a coworker while her husband was sleeping in their guest bedroom and that he hosted a Mushroom Day at their swanky Sag Harbor vacation home, where guests all ingested the hallucinogenic fungi. Christina also accused a number of Sage's friends, including his boss at Jefferies, Ben Lorello, of using cocaine. Sage, 42, who has denied all of his wife's allegations, would not comment on the divorce settlement. He did previously admit that he and his wife had used drugs 'at certain social events in the past,' \\xa0but stated 'the Wolf of Wall Street tale [Christina] tells this court is a work of fiction.' Christina has had her own problems with the law, having been caught on video inside the couple's house doing cocaine just this past July and being charged with\\xa0felony DWI and endangering the welfare of a child after she crashed her Range Rover into a telephone pole in May 2010 while her two young daughters were in the backseat. Shattered past: Christina admits now that she has a drug and alcohol problem that she is working on, having been charged with DWI in 2010 (mugshot on left) while he daughters were in the car, while Sage claims his wife's affidavit is a work of 'fiction' Because of this, Sage won custody of their two daughters, which led his wife to counter-sue and her affidavit to become public. Now it seems that both parties are ready to move on and enjoy a more private life. Said Christina, 'I’d like to put this behind us and move forward with a new chapter in my life as Christina di Mauro.' A source close to the case also revealed that Christina said in a statement that Sage is 'a great father who greatly loves our children' and that the two are 'both fully committed to co-parenting our children.' Christina also apologized to those who had been affected by this very public battle, specifically 'those at Jefferies and those associated with Jefferies.' She also said this 'amicable' settlement 'ensures loving homes for our children.'\",\n",

Speaking in California, YouTube chief executive Susan Wojcicki said that the firm is working on a paid-for service, and is ‘optimistic that [users] will see it soon.’ It is expected to rival Spotify by offering ad-free, and offline access to millions of videos. But Ms Wojcicki declined to say exactly when the service would launch while addressing the audience at Recode’s Code/Mobile conference in California. Prices have not been announced either. Speculation about YouTube’s Spotify rival began last year when ‘two people familiar with the matter’ announced its arrival was imminent. It is expected to allow playback of videos without adverts, and let people watch videos offline on mobile devices. This would match the options offered by Spotify on its own paid-for subscriptions, but with the added bonus of videos. Reports claim YouTube has already reached deals with all three major music labels - Universal Music Group, Sony Music Entertainment, and Warner Music Group - and many independent labels, representing about 95 per cent of all labels. But the sources added that a small number of independent artists who had not agreed to new deal terms will have their videos blocked in some countries starting in a few days, even on the free version of YouTube. YouTube is rumoured to be looking at ways to block the music videos so users of the test version won't be confused about which content they can access for free and with features require payment. The move also adds pressure on those labels to sign, because not being on YouTube altogether will result in less advertising revenue and exposure. Speculation about YouTube’s Spotify rival began last year. It is expected to allow playback of videos with adverts, and let people watch videos offline on mobile devices. This would match the options offered by Spotify on its own paid-for subscriptions, but with the added bonus of videos, for example. It will not be the first time YouTube has experimented with paid-for plans. In May last year, the Google-owned video giant launched a paid-for subscription service that charged users from 79p (99 cents) a month to watch videos on specialist channels, such as Comedy.TV and PGA Digital Golf. YouTube has more 1 million channels. More than 1 billion unique users visit YouTube each month. Over 4 billion hours of video are watched each month on YouTube. 72 hours of video are uploaded to YouTube every minute. 70 per cent of YouTube traffic comes from outside the US. YouTube is localized in 53 countries and across 61 languages. In 2011, YouTube had more than 1 trillion views or around 140 views for every person on Earth. Individual channels charge more for a subscription if they choose to, and the majority of UK subscriptions charge £1.49 ($2.50) a month. Over 50 channels were launched as subscription-only, but not all paid-for channels can be subscribed to in the UK - namely Jim Henson Family TV, and National Geographic Kids. The revenue split between YouTube and the channel producers and musicians is expected to be similar to the 45-55 split that YouTube currently has with advertising revenue. At a media conference last year, YouTube's CEO Salar Kamangar said that a subscription model would give networks and producers a more direct line to their audience with lower costs. A Google spokesman added: 'We have long maintained that different content requires different types of payment models. 'There are a lot of our content creators that think they would benefit from subscriptions, so we're looking at that.' It will not be the first time YouTube has experimented with paid-for plans.

Kevin Hughes, of Canvey, Essex, took part in clinical trials of Abiraterone to treat his prostate cancer. But the 58-year-old has been left devastated by a decision this week by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice) not to fund the drug for patients who, like him, have not undergone chemotherapy. Mr Hughes was given three years to live after being diagnosed with advanced prostate cancer last April. Scroll down for video. Kevin Hughes, pictured, has been left 'devastated' after being told the 'wonder drug' that has extended his life is too expensive for the NHS to fund. After taking part in a clinical trial for the drug Abiraterone before having chemotherapy, doctors now believe he will go on to live longer than expected. The drug is currently available on the NHS to men who have already gone through chemotherapy. But Nice has ruled that the 'wonder' medication is too expensive to give to men before they have undergone the much more gruelling cancer treatment. Mr Hughes, of Canvey, Essex, said: 'Under normal circumstances they give people Abiraterone when they are in the very advanced stages and everything else has failed. Abiraterone, pictured, is currently available on the NHS to men who have already gone through chemotherapy. 'Nice's decision is a very bad one. I can empirically show what the drug has done for me. 'It's just wonderful. Before I got on it, people were calling it the wonder drug and I have to say it's pretty special.' Mr Hughes was being treated with Zolodex hormone injections, which resulted in hot sweats and fatigue, and had radiotherapy before the start of the clinical trial. He said: 'I had no symptoms, so when I was diagnosed, let's say it wasn't my best day. 'I walked around in a fog for a week and so did my wife. But you get over it, readjust and get on with it. 'I was on the hormone therapy injections and the side effects were not great, but take it on the chin and get on with it.' Before being chosen for the trial, a blood test to measure the prostate-specific antigen found Mr Hughes' count had rocketed to 500. The normal range is between five and six. He said: 'It was coming down nicely on the Zolodex, but since being on Abiraterone, it dropped completely. One year on my count is so low it is undetectable. 'I would say my three-year prognosis has gone flying out of the window. 'My doctors are more cautious, but agree I will probably go past the dates they first thought. 'It's a no-brainer, it just works and personally I have had no side effects from it. 'It should be given to men before they even have to go through chemotherapy.' From April 2013 to March 2014, Abiraterone pre-chemotherapy was the second most requested drug on England's Cancer Drugs Fund. On Sunday, June 29, former Health Minister Paul Burstow urged the Department of Health to intervene in the Nice process and call off the proposed restriction on use of Abiraterone before chemotherapy. Abiraterone, also known as Zytiga, was used pre-chemotherapy by thousands of men last year through the Cancer Drugs Fund, which picks up the bill for patients in England. Above, prostate cancer cells. Owen Sharp, chief executive of Prostate Cancer UK, has criticised the Nice decision. He said: 'It's a fiasco. This decision is a kick in the teeth for men with advanced prostate cancer. 'For many, this presented a vital opportunity for extra time with loved ones and a chance to delay chemotherapy and the debilitating side effects which come with it.' In the case of Abiraterone, Nice said the drug was too costly to use at an earlier stage in the disease. When the drug is used after chemotherapy, different rules apply that take into account the end-of-life plight of patients which make the drug cost-effective. Although the drug is sold to the NHS at the same price at whatever stage in the disease it is used, the cost effectiveness formula becomes more expensive before chemotherapy. The official price of a month’s treatment is £3,000 but the NHS pays less through a discount scheme from the manufacturer. Nice chief executive Sir Andrew Dillon said: 'We know how important it is for patients to have the option to delay chemotherapy and its associated side effects, so we are disappointed not to be able to recommend abiraterone for use in this way. 'However, the manufacturer's own economic model demonstrated that the drug does not offer enough benefit to justify its price.'\",\n",

They. also warned that text-walkers are at risk of wandering in front of. traffic and stumbling onto train tracks – and urged pedestrians to stop. before type. The Australian researchers tracked the body movements of 26 young men and women as they tried to walk in a straight line. They walked the 30ft course three times – once without a mobile phone, once while reading a text message and once while typing a message. Their gait clearly changed when using their phone – with sending a text having a bigger impact than simply reading one. Texting caused people to slow down, swerve off course and move their head from side to side. They also developed a distinctive posture as they strained to keep their eyes on the screen. A review on iTunes by Dandy Crush said: ‘This app gives the effect that the phone screen is like glass that you can see right through. ‘It looks like they blur it a little too to help the words stand out more, kind of like a little hint of frosted glass. ‘It works great and I hope it saves me from future mishaps.’ The app, described as the ‘smarter, safer way to type while you're walking', can be downloaded on the iPhone, iPad and iPod Touch. Its iTunes blurb states: ‘Type n Walk displays a transparent viewport of what's directly in front of you. ‘This combined with your peripheral vision is just enough visual information to help you avoid obstacles - like walking face-first into a tree.’ Earlier this year, the University of Queensland said people who type text messages while walking develop a robot-like posture that puts them in danger of toppling over.

Now researchers report in the journal Nature Ecology & Evolution that \"positional bias\" is in fact observed in multiple mammal species, and they say the reason for it is likely neurological, as the BBC reports. Turns out that this positioning on the left activates the brain\\'s right hemisphere, responsible for processing social activities like communication and bonding. \"We suggest that this bias is even more widespread and may be a characteristic of all mammals, with few exceptions,\" one researcher says. Studying wild animals—including horses, walruses, reindeer, sheep, and kangaroos—the team also found a \"positional bias,\" but it varied depending on the situation. They found, for example, that young animals tend to keep their mothers on their left and watch her with mainly their left eye. In dangerous situations, however, the mothers would swap spots to keep their young on their left for better monitoring, reports New Scientist. The scientists recorded nearly 11,000 position choices across 175 pairs of infants and mothers. That the positional bias is so widespread among mammals suggests, as one researcher puts it, that the mechanism is \"ancient and really basic.\" Meanwhile, the Orange County Register reports on a thrilling drone sighting of a mother and calf whale migrating south—with predictable positioning.

I felt like I was in a padded asylum with mirrors, the asylum because I couldn't figure the place out. There is a DJ booth above the front door that is very easy to miss, and really a cool touch. The colors are all browns to keep with the nostalgic theme, and did I mention there are mirrors everywhere? The building and space get a 5. It's just cool.  We sat at the bar and were followed by a friendly little asian guy, with menus and he seemed genuinely interested in us having a good experience. He was previously across the street asking people to come over and try the restaurant. I wish I could say the bartender was half as friendly or committed to his job. The bald one was extremely unfriendly, seemed very arrogant, and for a person in a loud restaurant should practice his vocal skills. The service was prompt without mishaps throughout, but very cold.  I ordered the Carne Pizza. I have to say, it was one of the biggest disappointments I have had in a loooooong time. I have made better pizzas in my home oven that came from a box. Honestly... it had a paper thin cardboard like crust, no quality toppings, and not exactly a memorable taste. It tasted fine, and that was it's only redeeming quality. My neighbor had the roast beef sandwich and it was no better, or higher quality. The deli counter at Safeway can make a better sandwich. I earlier chastised someone for judging food on opening night, but now I see it really is bad, there is really no quality.  No sandwiches come with sides. No fries, no fruit, no salad, nothing. They are about $10, and if I want a great sandwich for $10 I'll go to Switch, and it will come with a great Caesar Salad on the side.  This is not a restaurant, but rather a bar that serves food. If I think of it like that... more like a bigger version of The Roosevelt, I can think a little more positive about this, but not much. Bad service, bad food, bad review. I'll not be coming back, even with the walking distance proximity. It's just not worth it, especially for the price, and to feel like a not busy staff doesn't want to be busy. We are now at the point where there are other options downtown that are better. It's no longer a Downtown where you can be mediocre and survive.\",\n",
              " \"Article: The Liberian economy had relied heavily on the mining of iron ore prior to the civil war. Liberia was a major exporter of iron ore on the world market. In the 1970s and 1980s, iron mining accounted for more than half of Liberia's export earnings. Since the coup d'état of 1980, the country's economic growth rate has slowed down because of a decline in the demand for iron ore on the world market and political upheavals in Liberia. Following a peak in growth in 1979, the Liberian economy began a steady decline due to economic mismanagement following the 1980 coup. This decline was accelerated by the outbreak of civil war in 1989; GDP was reduced by an estimated 90% between 1989 and 1995, one of the fastest declines in history. The United Nations imposed sanctions on Liberia in May 2001 for its support to the rebels of the Revolutionary United Front  in neighboring Sierra Leone. These sanctions have been lifted following elections in 2005. Upon the end of the war in 2003, GDP growth began to accelerate, reaching 9.4% in 2007. The global financial crisis slowed GDP growth to 4.6% in 2009, though a strengthening agricultural sector led by rubber and timber exports increased growth to 5.1% in 2010 and an expected 7.3% in 2011, making the economy one of the 20 fastest growing in the world. In March 2010, Bob Johnson, founder of BET, funded the first hotel constructed in Liberia in 20 years. The 13-acre  luxury resort was built in the Paynesville section of Monrovia. Liberia's external debt was estimated in 2006 at approximately $4.5 billion, 800% of GDP. As a result of bilateral, multilateral and commercial debt relief from 2007 to 2010, the country's external debt fell to $222.9 million by 2011.\",\n",

              " \"By. Ashley Collman for MailOnline. Donald Trump's 'pitbull' adviser is suing a Hamptons homeowner for 'ruining his summer'. Michael D Cohen rented an $8million Sagaponack mansion from NYU Dr Ali Guy, but says the physiatrist lied to him about the home's state. When Cohen and his extended family arrived at the home on August 2, they discovered that the air conditioning wasn't working and that half of the rooms were outfitted with too-small twin beds. Cohen paid $150,000 to rent the home for a month, and is now suing Guy for double, according to a suit filed in Manhattan Superior Court. 'He ruined my summer!' Cohen said, according to the New York Post. Not fit: Donald Trump's adviser Michael Cohen (left) is suing NYU Dr Ali Guy (right) for renting him an $8million Hamptons home he says was in disrepair. Upsetting: According to the $250,000 lawsuit, the home's air-conditioning was broken and the beds in four of the eight rooms were too small for the visiting adults. Cohen, a Trump Organization Vice President and special counsel to the Donald, says the home is more than double the size of his past rentals since he wanted a large space to house his wife, their two children, his parents, his three siblings, and his siblings' children. He eventually decided on Dr Guy's eight-bedroom, 12,000-square-foot home because it had enough room 'to accommodate his entire family' and for its 'wow factor,' according to the suit. According to a real estate listing, the home on Parsonage Lane sits on 1.2 acres and comes with formal living and dining rooms, a great room, screening room, gym, spa, wine cellar, two laundry rooms, pool, three-story elevator and 11.5 bathrooms. But Cohen says that while the home is aesthetically pleasing, it is non-functional. Not happy: Cohen admits the home is aesthetically pleasing, but that the various problems have ruined his summer vacation. Small: One of the biggest issues Cohen has with the home are the too-small twin beds in half of the rooms. Stuck inside: Cohen has also had to spend hours at home, supervising maintenance workers trying to repair the air-conditioning, missing out on family time. Bad surprise: The home's sauna and security gate have also had issues that were specified when Cohen agreed to rent the home for $150,000. The home has had multiple issues that has tainted Cohen's summer and made it nearly uninhabitable for his family, who came all the way from California and Florida for a reunion. Right-hand man: Cohen is an Executive Vice President of the Trump Organization and special adviser to the Donald. One of the biggest issues was the twin beds in four of the eight rooms - too small for his 6-foot-tall teen soon or his married sisters. He says the broker was forced to buy two big beds with mattresses, box springs and frames just to 'make things right'. Cohen also found that the sauna was broken, the security gate malfunctioned and the toilets were busted. Even worse - the air-conditioning wasn't working in two of the bedrooms. When. he confronted Guy about the air-conditioning issues in the heat of. summer, the landlord told him to open the windows at night and 'hope for. sea breeze' even though the house isn't on the beach. Contractors. were called out to the house to fix the AC, but were unsuccessful. While they worked Cohen was stuck in the house supervising, missing out. on time with his family. Dr Guy has spoken out about the suit and told the Post Cohen's complaints are 'completely unfounded'. 'He wants to sue me for $250,000 and his rent was $150,000' Dr Guy said. 'We are filing a response, and I feel I will be vindicated,' he added. Cohen has been called Trump's 'pitbull' and has been given the nicknqame 'Tom' in reference to The Godfather character.\",\n",

Jacob Morgan \\n  \\n 21st Space Wing Public Affairs \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n 5/28/2014 - PETERSON AIR FORCE BASE, Colo. -- Most people think that during an emergency they would step up to the plate, act heroically and do what is necessary to save lives. Thinking one might rescue the day is a noble thought, but acting on those thoughts is what sets the nation\\'s heroes above noble thinkers. \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n \"Every pilot thinks \\'what would I do if this all goes wrong\\' on an aircraft they are not controlling,\" said Capt. Mark Gongol, 13th Air Support Operations Squadron assistant director of operations at Fort Carson. \"As a professional courtesy, we all know the aircrew at civilian airlines are extremely qualified, but as a byproduct of being a pilot, I always have a heightened awareness when flying. However, I never thought I would be in the situation I was in.\" \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n Gongol, his wife and daughter were on the way from Des Moines International Airport Dec. 30, with 151 other passengers and six crewmembers, after spending the holidays with his family. To him and his family, the day was just like any other, except for a short flight delay due to weather. \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n Approximately 30 minutes into the flight, Gongol, a B-1B Lancer pilot, noticed the engines power down to idle. The thoughts immediately started jumping through his head; there were a variety of reasons why the engines would shut down to idle, none of them categorized as normal. Slowly, the aircraft began to descend and turn right. \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n \"Over the public address system; a flight attendant asked if there was a doctor on board the plane,\" said Gongol. \"A few more calls went out for medical professionals and the flight attendants were all hurrying to first class with their beverage carts and a first-aid kit.\" \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n At that moment, Gongol thought it was a medical emergency with a first class passenger, his instincts told him to stay seated and stay out of the way. A fourth call went out, \"are there any non-revenue pilots on board, please ring your call button.\" Immediately, Gongol realized the pilot was the patient. He looked to his wife; as she gave him a nod, Gongol pressed his button and headed toward the flight deck. \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n Arriving at the flight deck, Gongol saw four flight attendants and two passenger nurses assembling a make-shift bed, medical kits were strewn across the ground and the captain of the aircraft was seated in his chair, eyes dilated, sweaty, clammy and disoriented. Gongol immediately thought the pilot was suffering some serious cardiac trauma. \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n \"After they moved the pilot, I was asked by the first officer, \\'are you a pilot,\\' which was quickly followed with \\'what do you fly,\\'\" said Gongol. \"I knew she was in a serious situation and that question gave her five seconds to judge if I would be useful. I also had about five seconds to asses her, \\'was she panicking, or was she OK to fly the aircraft?\\' We both finished our silent assessments, she made the right judgment and told me to close the door and have a seat.\" \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n From there, Gongol was calm and collected, and the first officer decided that he would be most useful to talk on the radios, back her up on the aircraft\\'s checklists and look for anything going wrong. \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n Having been an aircraft commander, Gongol is used to making decisions, but he knew the best way to get the aircraft down safely was to play a support role to the first officer and make things as normal as possible for her. In an emergency situation, he had the ability to place himself outside the situation for a second and make the right call. \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n \"She was calm, but you could tell she was a little stressed, who wouldn\\'t be,\" said Gongol. \"At the beginning, I interrupted her flow of operations, but we figured everything out extremely quickly. She was very impressive.\" \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n There were hundreds of issues the two pilots talked through on the aircraft while descending; cabin pressure, approach, contact with air traffic control, visual cues and programming of the auto-pilot were just a few, said Gongol. At about 500 feet above ground level, the first officer hand-flew the approach to a normal touchdown. \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n After landing, the first officer turned to Gongol and asked if he knew where to taxi, she had never been to the Omaha airport before. Taken aback by how cool, calm and collected the first officer had acted without knowing the airport, Gongol remembered landing at the airport before pilot training. \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n \"Surprisingly, taxiing was the most stressful part of the day for the first officer,\" said Gongol. \"She had never taxied a 737 before and the ATC had no idea that the pilot was the reason for the emergency. We had to make a quick decision that her switching to the pilot\\'s seat and taxiing the aircraft without the training was necessary to save the captain\\'s life.\" \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n As the air stairs went down and the aircraft was shut down, Gongol and the first officer talked through the decisions they had just made. Gongol assured the first officer that every decision she made would be backed up by him; he would have taken the exact same actions had he been in her place. \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n The captain of the aircraft is recovering well and contacted Gongol directly to thank him. The crew of the aircraft, the two nurses who provided first aid for the captain and the first officer have all been in contact with Gongol; an emergency has brought together several strangers as friends. \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n \"I saw nothing but the finest professionalism under pressure out of the flight attendants, the nurses and the first officer,\" said Gongol. \"Everyone aboard the aircraft remained calm, there is no doubt in my mind this contributed above all else to our successful outcome. In my opinion any military pilot would have done the exact same thing I did.\" \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n Gongol acted in an emergency situation, realized the role that would be best for him to play and while he was not necessarily the direct savior to more than 150 souls on board, his actions contributed to a safe ending to the flight. His actions, according to him, do not make him a hero. However, they surely place him one step above a noble thinker. |||||',\n",

All right, the love story between Jack and Rose is very unrealistic, everyone knows that love like this doesn\\'t actually exist. But this is a movie, doesn\\'t everyone enjoy watching a beautiful story that lets us slip slightly into fantasy for a while? The next complaint, DiCaprio and Winslet are terrible actors. Well, OK, in this movie, I agree that they do not perform to their full potentials. However I think it\\'s unfair to say that they are terrible actors. I personally think they are both very talented actors who unfortunately are very famous for a movie that they are not amazing in. But the roles they are given are simple, and the characters seem real enough that you can care about them quite a bit, but I agree with many people that they did not do as well as could have been expected.\\n\\nAnd finally, if one is going to complain that they don\\'t like this movie because they hate romance, or because they hate history, or tragic movies, then I\\'m sorry but why on earth did they go and see a movie that is so clearly all of these things.

The flashback portion of the story can be quite weak at times, but overall it\\'s an amazing achievement in making the Titanic look so real, and the sinking feel so epic.\\n\\nI understand why a lot of people dislike this movie, but for the most part it boils down to them disliking the fundamental idea, such as it being a love story, rather than them thinking the movie in and of itself is poorly constructed.\\n\\nI can tell you that I have read more than five books about the Titanic, including memoirs form the day it happened, and this movie is extremely historically accurate save just a few faults. The only main ones I can find is that the piping should be threaded copper, not steel, and the iceberg looks fairly unrealistic as is the scene where they hit it.\\n\\nI give this movie 10/10, not because I like romance movies, but simply because it\\'s an outstanding cinematic achievement, that leaves one feeling horrified by the realistic adaptation of events.',\n",

Thompson\\'s ashes over Aspen, Colo., spent $30,000 a month on expensive wines, and apparently just wasted much of the rest of his income, according to a lawsuit filed by his former managers. The lawsuit, filed as a countersuit to Depp\\'s $25 million suit against The Management Group, claims that Depp lived an \"ultra-extravagant lifestyle\" that he couldn\\'t really afford, with other spending including $75 million on 14 residences around the world, $18 million on a 150-foot yacht, and $10 million to support family and friends, the San Francisco Chronicle reports. The countersuit claims Depp needed 12 storage facilities for his collection of Hollywood memorabilia and fine art, the Telegraph reports. The former managers, who represented the actor from 1999 until 2016, say they repeatedly warned Depp about the unsustainable spending, meaning \"Depp, and Depp alone, is fully responsible for any financial turmoil he finds himself in today.\" Depp\\'s lawsuit accuses the managers of mishandling more than $25 million and failing to file his taxes on time, costing him millions in penalties.

Reporting in the journal BMJ Open, the researchers noted their survey of 113 women who had experienced early pregnancy loss \"surprised\" them: The researchers found 38% of those women met the criteria for probably PTSD three months after their loss. Those women who suffered a miscarriage versus an ectopic pregnancy, where the fetus develops outside the womb, were more likely to report PTSD symptoms at that point: 45% to 18%, respectively. Distressing or frightening events can trigger PTSD, which can involve flashbacks, nightmares, or intrusive thoughts and is often characterized by anger, depression, or insomnia.

              " 'Uber\\'s Travis Kalanick Announces Leave Of Absence; Company Adopts Harassment Policies \\n  \\n Enlarge this image toggle caption Eric Risberg/AP Eric Risberg/AP \\n  \\n Uber made two big announcements Tuesday, adopting new policies to improve its workplace environment and saying CEO Travis Kalanick is going on a leave of absence for personal reasons. Kalanick said he needs time to grieve the recent death of his mother. \\n  \\n \"The ultimate responsibility, for where we\\'ve gotten and how we\\'ve gotten here rests on my shoulders,\" Kalanick said. \"There is of course much to be proud of but there is much to improve.\" \\n  \\n Kalanick said he would be working on a team that could lead \"Uber 2.0.\" \\n  \\n \"But if we are going to work on Uber 2.0, I also need to work on Travis 2.0 to become the leader that this company needs and that you deserve,\" he added. \\n  \\n The statement was included in Uber\\'s note announcing new policies that are meant to help it fight sexual harassment and change a corporate culture that has been blamed for allowing workplace misconduct to flourish. Uber\\'s board unanimously accepted former Attorney General Eric Holder\\'s recommendations for improving the company. \\n  \\n The first recommendation in the report, according to a 13-page summary, is titled \"Changes to Senior Leadership.\" It calls for some of Kalanick\\'s duties to be reallocated and emphasizes the importance of the company\\'s plan to hire a chief operating officer. \\n  \\n Other recommendations ranged from improving accountability and training at the company to bolstering both Uber\\'s human resources department and its employee complaint process. The plan also calls for increasing diversity and establishing a version of the NFL\\'s \"Rooney Rule\" that would require Uber to include at least one female and one minority candidate in hiring for jobs and to include a woman and/or a minority on hiring panels. \\n  \\n As Uber released details of the plan to its roughly 12,000 employees Tuesday, Chief Human Resources Officer Liane Hornsey said: \\n  \\n \"Implementing these recommendations will improve our culture, promote fairness and accountability, and establish processes and systems to ensure the mistakes of the past will not be repeated. \"While change does not happen overnight, we\\'re committed to rebuilding trust with our employees, riders and drivers.\" \\n  \\n The need for a new approach was highlighted by former Uber engineer Susan Fowler, who published a blog post in February in which she said that she was sexually harassed at the company and that both managers and the human resources unit ignored her complaints. \\n  \\n In response to that and similar accusations, Uber fired 20 employees, including senior executives, and reprimanded 40 more employees. Those moves came last week, after an outside firm was hired to investigate more than 200 misconduct claims against the company, as NPR\\'s Yuki Noguchi reported. \\n  \\n Another recommendation in the new plan calls for Uber to forbid \"any type of romantic or intimate relationship between individuals in a reporting relationship.\" It also calls on the company to prohibit the consumption of alcohol during core work hours and to ban the use of controlled substances. \\n  \\n The final item in the summary that Uber released Tuesday calls for a review of the company\\'s pay practices to make sure it complies with state and federal equal pay laws. \\n  \\n The new plan is emerging at a time of turmoil for Uber\\'s top executives. Its president, Jeff Jones, quit in March after less than six months. \\n  \\n Later Tuesday, a comment about women reportedly made by board member David Bonderman at an all-staff meeting drew outrage and reportedly has led to his resignation. \\n  \\n \"There\\'s a lot of data that shows that when there\\'s one woman on the board, it\\'s much more likely that there will be a second woman on the board,\" board member Arianna Huffington said, according to leaked audio published by Yahoo Finance. \\n  \\n Bonderman then interjected: \"Actually, what it shows is that it\\'s much likely to be more talking.\" \\n  \\n News outlets including the New York Times later reported that Bonderman had resigned from the board, saying his comment had not reflected what he intended to say. \\n  \\n Earlier, Bonderman reportedly apologized in an email to staff. Uber\\'s PR team reweeted a Times reporter\\'s post with an excerpt from the apology, where Bonderman called it a \"disrespectful comment\" and saying \"I deeply regret it.\" \\n  \\n Thanks to an aggressive growth strategy, Uber now operates in cities on six continents. Valued at around $70 billion, it\\'s one of the largest private companies in the world. But its reputation has suffered over the harassment reports, and the company has also faced challenges to its labor and competition practices, as well as a lawsuit from Google\\'s parent company over its self-driving vehicle program. \\n  \\n Here is how NPR\\'s Aarti Shahani described perceptions about Kalanick, after news of his leave of absence began to circulate Monday: \\n  \\n \"We really don\\'t know too much about this yet, but a couple weeks ago, his mom died in a boating accident, and his dad landed in the hospital — so I mean really horrible personal loss. And it could be he just needs a break. It could also be that leadership is losing faith in his ability to pivot the company.\" \\n  \\n The board first announced it had adopted the proposals in Holder\\'s report on Sunday; hours afterward, the company saw another high-profile departure, as senior vice president for business Emil Michael announced his resignation. ||||| These crawls are part of an effort to archive pages as they are created and archive the pages that they refer to.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings. \\n  \\n / Updated By Alyssa Newcomb \\n  \\n Amid allegations of sexual harassment and discrimination that spawned two independent reports and forced the company to re-examine its culture, rideshare giant Uber held an all-hands meeting Tuesday that could be a game changer. \\n  \\n Travis Kalanick, Uber\\'s CEO, announced he will take a leave of absence from the company. After several high profile departures, what\\'s left of Uber\\'s management team is small and there isn\\'t a clear leader in the pipeline to take over for Kalanick. \\n  \\n It appears the duties of CEO will be shared across Uber\\'s leadership team and not shouldered by one person. Kalanick had 13 people reporting directly to him, including senior vice president Ryan Graves, the first CEO of Uber. \\n  \\n \"During this interim period, the leadership team, my directs, will be running the company. I will be available as needed for the most strategic decisions, but I will be empowering them to be bold and decisive in order to move the company forward swiftly,\" Kalanick wrote in an email to employees. \\n  \\n Uber CEO Travis Kalanick speaks to students during an interaction at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) campus in Mumbai, India on Jan. 19, 2016.

The investigation, which was conducted by former attorney general Eric Holder, recommends the board have Kalanick share some responsibilities or reallocate some of them. \\n  \\n Kalanick is also stepping away at a deeply emotional time as he deals with a personal tragedy: His mother, Bonnie Kalanick, was killed in a boating accident last month. His father, Donald Kalanick, was seriously injured. \\n  \\n The company has been conducting a search for a chief operating officer since Kalanick admitted earlier this year that he needs leadership help; and Uber\\'s Chief Business Officer Emil Michael left the company on Monday. Uber President Jeff Jones departed earlier this year after less than one year on the job. \\n  \\n Related: Uber CEO\\'s Right-Hand Man Is the Latest to Leave ||||| Uber Technologies Inc.’s misfortunes may have created an opening for its underdog rival Lyft Inc. \\n  \\n In 2017, Uber has been plagued by an anti-immigration protest leading to a #deleteuber campaign from consumers, reports of sexual harassment at the company levied by a former engineer, a lawsuit from Alphabet Inc. GOOGL, +0.32% GOOG, +0.38% over self-driving car technology and a criminal investigation into Greyball, Uber’s software program that helped drivers evade government officials. \\n  \\n During that time period, Lyft has been closing the gap with Uber in terms of app downloads. Now, with an investigation that called for a revamp of Uber’s culture and led to Uber Chief Executive Travis Kalanick stepping down shown to be harming Uber’s brand, the lead could narrow even more. \\n  \\n Uber still has a lead over Lyft in terms of daily downloads in the U.S., according to app analytics firm App Annie, but Lyft has been closing the gap this year, with about a 70% difference between the two companies as of May. \\n  \\n Lyft is concentrated in the U.S., so from January to May, 95% of its downloads on iOS and Google Play were in the U.S. In that same period, only 15% of Uber’s downloads were in the U.S. During January’s #deleteuber protest, Lyft beat Uber in terms of downloads on iOS devices for the first time. \\n  \\n Behind the download trends, American consumer favorability of Uber has hit a record low, according to Morning Consult Brand Intelligence, a brand survey firm. Using a national sample of close to 40,000 U.S. adults, the firm found that just 40% of the respondents had a favorable impression of Uber as of Monday, the lowest that number has dropped since the survey began in 2016. \\n  \\n Lyft is still the smaller player to Uber, with a valuation of $7.5 billion compared with Uber’s $68 billion. Lyft also has less of a footprint, with drivers in 350 U.S. cities, while Uber is in more than 70 countries and 460 cities. \\n  \\n But Lyft has taken a route of partnering to expand its global footprint while also teaming up with auto manufacturers, including Alphabet’s self-driving car unit Waymo, which is odds with Uber. The partnerships include a $25 million investment from Jaguar Land Rover, which Lyft announced Monday. \\n  \\n “People are looking at Lyft with more favorable opinion,” said Santosh Rao, head of research at Manhattan Venture Partners. \\n  \\n Meanwhile, Uber has been losing executives, including Kalanick, who is taking a leave of absence for an unspecified amount of time. On Monday, the company’s head of business, Emil Michael, stepped down. Uber fired Anthony Levandowski, former head of Uber’s self-driving car unit at the center of Alphabet’s lawsuit, in late May after the company said he had failed to cooperate with its investigation. \\n  \\n Among these departures and earlier resignations, Uber is operating without a chief operating officer, chief financial officer, chief marketing officer and head of engineering. Uber has divided up responsibilities for running the company among several of Kalanick’s direct reports, according to Recode. \\n  \\n Amid Uber’s troubles, Lyft has largely stayed out of the spotlight, which Jeremy Robinson-Leon, principal at Group Gordon, a corporate and crisis PR firm, said may have helped its perception from consumers. \\n  \\n “In some cases like this it’s better to simply let your competitor self-destruct,” Robinson-Leon said. \\n  \\n But that self-destruction isn’t assured. While Uber has a wide breadth of issues, which he said may only be comparable to Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc.’s CMG, -0.16% food borne illness scandal for their “unstoppable flow,” it could turn it around by taking “big corrective action.” \\n  \\n He added however, that even though Uber said Tuesday that it had chosen to adopt all the recommendations from the investigation led by former Attorney General Eric Holder, including recommendations on addressing discrimination and harassment, it still has lingering issues that the report does not correct. \\n  \\n Additionally, consumer sentiment does not always translate to corporate impact. Uber revealed some financial results through a leak to The Wall Street Journal, showing that its first-quarter revenue was $3.4 billion, up 18% from the fourth-quarter and that it had pared its loss down to $708 million, excluding employee stock compensation and other metrics. \\n  \\n Though Rao sees Tuesday’s report as an “inflection point” for Uber, he feels that the company still has some to regain ground, as it has such a large world-wide footprint in terms of cities and drivers. The most important step, he said, is to find a chief operating officer to take control and implement the changes in the company’s culture. \\n  \\n “They need to manage their next steps really well,” Rao said. “If there are any more incidents like this, that could prove to be fatal.” ||||| About Your Privacy on this Site \\n  \\n Welcome!

You can read the 13-page letter with all recommendations here. But tl;dr, some key recommendations include “reallocating the responsibilities” of Uber CEO Travis Kalanick and increasing the profile of Uber’s head of diversity Bernard Coleman. Kalanick has announced in a separate letter to employees he would be taking a leave of absence from the company. \\n  \\n Other important changes will be to increase Uber’s board independence from the company, to create a separate ethics and culture committee or similar committees, to use compensation to hold senior leaders accountable and to eliminate certain company values like “Let Builders Build” and “Always Be Hustlin’,” which were used in the past to justify bad behavior. \\n  \\n The internal probe was based on a litany of allegations made by former Uber engineer Susan Fowler, including that she was discriminated against based on her gender and that the company ignored her repeated complaints of sexual harassment at the hands of her supervisor, basing it on the fact that he was a “high performer.” Uber’s head of HR Liane Hornsey has reportedly thanked Fowler in the all-hands meeting for kicking off the changes. \\n  \\n However, Fowler maintains Uber has never apologized to her. She responded in a tweet to the recommendations letter shortly after it was posted this morning: \\n  \\n Ha! Yeah, they\\'ll never apologize. I\\'ve gotten nothing but aggressive hostility from them. It\\'s all optics. — Susan Fowler (@susanthesquark) June 13, 2017 \\n  \\n I\\'m going to keep saying this until things actually change. https://t.co/O0lpsgykHR — Susan Fowler (@susanthesquark) June 13, 2017 \\n  \\n Other recommendations include giving out free Uber credits to employees (early employees got the credits but now every employee will be able to use them), equal family leave time for both male and female employees and dinner served earlier than 7 pm as part of an effort to encourage a healthy work/life balance. \\n  \\n The law firm’s recommendations touch nearly every aspect of the company and signal Uber is intent on creating the kind of internal change needed to move it toward a more inclusive workplace. \\n  \\n Kalanick did not name a temporary new CEO and it is possible he could stay close to the company during his leave. “During this interim period, the leadership team, my directs, will be running the company,” Kalanick wrote. \\n  \\n However, his decision to step down for an undetermined amount of time follows earlier rumors the board had been discussing a possible leave of absence for the CEO. Externally Kalanick and his executive team have been blamed for creating a bro culture rife with misogyny. However, inside sources intimate the CEO has a loyal following and a recent New York Times piece shows Kalanick may have even more clout within. \\n  \\n The shakeup has already prompted departures from several top executives at the company, and Uber has fired at least 20 employees since beginning a separate internal investigation with law firm Perkins and Coie into other forms of harassment and discrimination. Emil Michael, Uber’s former SVP of business and the man who once suggested Uber could and should perform opposition research on journalists, also stepped down from his position yesterday, amid the turmoil. \\n  \\n You can read the full recommendation report here. |||||',\n",

              " 'Despite endless rounds of studies and tests, it seems no one has quite figured out if red wine is good or bad for our health. But one cardiologist made up his mind a long time ago – and has been doling out glasses of red to his patients for the past ten years. Dr William McCrea is convinced that the drink helps prevent heart attacks and strokes and is often found wheeling a trolley of wine on his rounds. Cardiologist Dr William McCrea prescribes red wine to his patients to prevent heart attacks and strokes. Dr McCrea says drinking two small glasses a day can reduce the risk of a heart attack by half. According to Dr McCrea, pictured, the antioxidants found in the seeds and skins used to make red wine can dramatically improve your health. And the most beneficial wines won’t break the bank – as they can all be found on your supermarket shelves. He recommends drinking cheap, new varieties made from grapes grown at higher altitudes.These are exposed to higher levels of UV radiation, giving them a greater concentration of antioxidants. Among the cardiologist’s preferred varieties are a Pinot Noir or a Shiraz from South Africa, an Argentinian Malbec or his particular favourite, a Cabernet Sauvignon from Chile. The consultant prescribes the drink to. patients in the cardiology ward like he would any other medicine, with. precise measures to be taken at regular intervals. He says their good. results support the theory that drinking a small amount every day can be. beneficial. Dr McCrea began. to hand out wine after discovering that the French suffer from far. fewer heart attacks, despite their fatty diets and higher smoking rates. He believes the. antioxidant properties of red wine reduce the risk of second heart. attacks by half – and the risk of stroke by 20 per cent. The. cardiologist has now recommended two 125ml glasses a day to around. 10,000 patients at the Great Western Hospital in Swindon, Wiltshire. And. he insists that young wines in screw-top bottles – which are usually. the cheapest – are the healthiest varieties. Fortunately. his local supermarkets usually stock enough of his recommended tipple, a. Montes Reserva Cabernet Sauvignon which costs around £7 a bottle. Dr. McCrea, 58, explained: ‘The French consume twice the amount of fat we. do, smoke more, and they don’t do any more exercise than us, but their. rate of deaths from heart attacks is half of ours. What’s the. difference? They drink red wine like we drink tea. ‘It’s. their drinking behaviour that’s important. The British don’t drink. alcohol regularly, but when we do, we drink to excess. They don’t, as a. rule. Dr McCrea, who works at Great Western Hospital, in Swindon (pictured), has given red wine to 10,000 patients over the last 10 years and says the results among his patients are notable. ‘Also the wine cheers. patients up and focuses them on their recovery by relaxing them during a. very tense period. Hardly any of my patients who have a heart attack. who go on to have red wine ever come back into the hospital again, which. is unusual. ‘I’ve given it to 10,000 patients and the chances of a second heart attack have been reduced by around 50 per cent.’ The skins of certain red wine grapes, which are used in the fermenting process, are particularly rich in antioxidants. One. antioxidant called resveratrol is particularly good at mopping up. chemicals responsible for causing blood clots, the primary cause of. heart disease. This prevents clots from developing inside the arteries, raising levels of good cholesterol and causing the arteries to dilate. Dr. McCrea recommends young red wines with the highest antioxidant. concentrations, which tend to come from high altitudes. However white. wine does not have the same benefit as the healthy chemicals found in. the grape skins are discarded during its manufacture. Speaking. from his home in Swindon, he said: ‘Initially people tend to be a bit. surprised by my approach. But I find that quite apart from the medicinal. effects, the wine is a good distraction. ‘When. somebody has a heart attack it’s a shock, people are alarmed and. anxious so the red wine also helps to relax them and reduce stress.’',\n",

His ex-wife, however, says some of that money should instead be in her pockets. In a lawsuit, Janet Foisie explains she and Robert were married for 50 years before they opted to divorce in 2010. The couple agreed to split their assets and eventually did so; during the process, Robert stated he did not have \"any offshore assets,\" the lawsuit says. But that wasn\\'t in fact the case, alleges Janet, who claims Robert had $4.5 million hidden in a Swiss account and transferred the money to WPI as part of a $40 million donation in 2014, per the Telegram & Gazette. \"Like one laundering the proceeds of a criminal enterprise, Robert sought to dispose of the funds for a purpose of his personal preference and choosing, rather than give it to his legitimate creditor Janet,\" who \"agreed to a smaller award of marital assets than she would have agreed to had she known the truth,\" per the lawsuit, which names WPI but not Robert. The suit asks that a temporary injunction be issued to keep WPI from using any funds given to it by Robert since 2011, and that a receiver be appointed to control the money. In a statement, WPI says, \"We have no knowledge of any of the improper conduct alleged in the lawsuit\" and \"hope the Foisies are able to work out their differences.\" MassLive notes the Foisies divvied up their homes and each walked with $20 million worth of securities.',\n",

Here’s what would make a really ace birthday present: Mail. From you, or me, or anyone, really. \\n  \\n That’s it. \\n  \\n It doesn’t even have to be a proper birthday card. A quick note will do; just pop it in the mail, to a P.O. Box in Washington state. And maybe toss in some stickers while you’re at it, because Everson’s father, Thomas, told KCPQ, a FOX affiliate, that his son loves them. \\n  \\n “Even if it’s junk mail, we give it to him and we say, ‘Here Bubby, here’s your mail,\\'” his mother, Brandi McNerney-Everson, told KCPQ. \\n  \\n Here’s why: Bubby has been diagnosed with a virus, which is actually not a big deal for many people but can sometimes be quite serious. The mail birthday happened because Bubby can’t have a traditional party, his mother told The Post in a phone interview Wednesday. The risk that he’d catch something and end up sick is too high. \\n  \\n “CMV is very scary, and it’s important for pregnant women to know about it,” Brandi McNerney-Everson said. “I tell every pregnant woman I come in contact with. Even though it’s scary, I say ‘hey you need to know about this,’ because it can be very devastating.” \\n  \\n The almost-9 Bubby has myriad health concerns. His long list of medical problems includes autism, cerebral palsy and epilepsy, his family says. He’s deaf, and suffers from scoliosis, according to KCPQ. \\n  \\n “He’s happy, and he’s loving, and he’s caring, and he’s a fighter,” his mother told KCPQ. “I don’t think he’d be here if he wasn’t a fighter.” \\n  \\n The station’s story aired this week, and the family has already started to receive letters. McNerney-Everson said she picked up a couple garbage bags full of notes already, and a few packages, and on second thought, maybe not so much with the stickers, because they family might be flooded with them by the end of this. \\n  \\n “It has restored my faith in humanity,” McNerney-Everson said told The Post. \\n  \\n Here’s the address to send a card, in case you were interested: \\n  \\n Bubby Everson \\n  \\n P.O. Box 1142 \\n  \\n Graham, Washington \\n  \\n 98338 \\n  \\n “It makes me feel better knowing that people care,” McNerney-Everson told The Post. “It’s been an amazing couple days, that’s for sure.” \\n  \\n [This post has been updated.] ||||| Please enable Javascript to watch this video \\n  \\n GRAHAM, Washington -- Most little boys dream big for their birthdays. They hope for a new bike, a remote control car or a video game system. \\n  \\n But one Washington State boy has a much simpler wish for his upcoming 9th birthday. \\n  \\n Bubby Everson just wants a little mail. \\n  \\n “He loves mail,” says Bubby’s mom Brandi McNerney-Everson. “Even if it`s junk mail we give it to him and we say here Bubby here’s your mail.” \\n  \\n A simple card can make his day. \\n  \\n And if there happens to be a sticker inside? \\n  \\n “If there are stickers in it he loves,” says Bubby’s dad Thomas Everson. “He’ll play with the stickers. He’ll put stickers all over the place.” \\n  \\n Bubby’s parents let him put those stickers anywhere he wants, on the walls, on the floors on the windows because it is a reminder for them that each day he can do it is another day of life for their son. \\n  \\n Bubby has Cytomegalovirus or CMV. \\n  \\n Usually it`s harmless, but in some cases it can be devastating. \\n  \\n In Bubby’s case doctors say it will be fatal, it is only a matter of time. \\n  \\n Bubby uses cochlear implant to hear and wears casts on both feet to help with the scoliosis, when he`s not in his wheelchair. \\n  \\n But that’s just where his troubles begin. \\n  \\n “The short list, autism, cerebral palsy, epilepsy, deafness, scoliosis,” says Thomas. \\n  \\n On a bad day, Bubby can have as many as 10 seizures and uses a homemade safe space routinely. \\n  \\n “It`s very tough, I love him to death and I wouldn`t change him but knowing that could lose him at any time that`s hard,” says Brandi. \\n  \\n Doctors can`t give his parents an exact date, but they know he will die well before his time. \\n  \\n And that brings us back to Bubby’s upcoming birthday. He turns 9 on February 11th and his parents are hoping they’ll have mail they can give him on that special day. \\n  \\n Bubby’s parents know they must treat every birthday as if it will be the last they get to celebrate with their son. \\n  \\n “He`s happy, and loving and he`s caring and he`s a fighter,” says Brandi. “I don`t think he`d be here if he wasn`t a fighter.” \\n  \\n Still Brandi and Thomas don’t want to leave anything to chance on this birthday. That’s why they have begun asking everyone they meet if they would consider sending Bubby some mail for his special day. \\n  \\n They’ve set up a special post office box in their small town of Graham to collect what they receive so that on the big day they might be able to shower their son in cards and stickers. \\n  \\n “We`re blessed,” says Brandi. “I`m so glad we have the child that we have….have the life that we have, because he`s amazing.” \\n  \\n When it’s all said and done, Bubby is really just an 8-year-old boy who is excited about his birthday. \\n  \\n -- \\n  \\n EDITOR’S NOTE: If you would like to send a mail, cards, or stickers to Bubby for his birthday please consider sending them to the following address: \\n  \\n Bubby Everson \\n  \\n PO BOX 1142 \\n  \\n Graham, Washington 98338 \\n  \\n The family is also trying to raise money for a special sensory room for Bubby, for more information on that visit their online fundraising website. |||||',\n",

              " 'LONDON Canadian pop star Justin Bieber was filmed lunging and shouting abuse at a photographer on Friday during an ill-fated stay in London which has gone from bad to worse after he collapsed on stage the day before. \\n  \\n The altercation, caught on camera and featured on popular celebrity news websites including TMZ, showed the 19-year-old get out of a van, try to move towards the unnamed member of the paparazzi and threaten him using several swear words. \\n  \\n He was reacting to the man\\'s foul-mouthed criticism of him and his security team after the singer appeared to have made contact with the photographer as they moved towards the vehicle. \\n  \\n The bouncers held Bieber back, but the incident is likely to create yet more negative headlines for one of the world\\'s biggest pop stars. \\n  \\n Bieber said he would go ahead with a scheduled Friday concert, the final of four gigs at London\\'s O2 Arena, which had been in doubt after he collapsed on stage on Thursday after suffering from shortness of breath. \\n  \\n After a 20-minute break during which he was given oxygen by doctors, he completed his set but was later taken to hospital as a precaution. \\n  \\n \"Justin has been released from the hospital after a check-up and while he\\'s feeling a little under the weather, he\\'s planning on going ahead with tonight\\'s show,\" his spokesman said. \\n  \\n \"ROUGH WEEK\" \\n  \\n Since being discovered on YouTube in 2008, Bieber quickly built a huge following of mainly teenaged girls attracted to his clean-cut image, slick videos and catchy pop songs. \\n  \\n But the intense media spotlight which follows him around the world has clearly unnerved the \"Boyfriend\" singer. \\n  \\n Bieber has had several run-ins with paparazzi in recent years and took to Twitter this week to criticize the media for what he called fabricated stories about him during his stay in London, where he is performing his sold out \"Believe\" tour. \\n  \\n After the latest altercation, he returned to the micro-blogging site, where he has more than 35 million followers. \\n  \\n \"Ahhhhh! Rough morning.

              " 'It is typically $1,000 or a multiple of that amount. Remember that the face value is the principal amount to be paid back when the bond reaches maturity. Pretend that in this case, the face value of the bond is $1000. This means you \"loaned out\" $1000, and expect $1000 back at the bond\\'s maturity. The rate is stated in the bond\\'s paperwork. It may also be called the face, nominal or contractual interest rate.  The coupon rate established when the bond was issued remains unchanged and is used to determine interest payments until the bond reaches maturity. In this case, assume the coupon is 5%. By multiplying the bond\\'s face value by its coupon interest rate, you can figure out what the dollar amount of that interest rate is each year.   For example, if the bond\\'s face value is $1000, and the interest rate is 5%, by multiplying 5% by $1000, you can find out exactly how much money you will receive each year. Remember when multiplying a number by a percent, to convert the number to a decimal. For example, 5% would be 0.05. $1000 multiplied by 0.05 would equal $50. Therefore, your annual interest payment is $50. Interest is typically paid twice a year.   This information is stated when you purchase the bond. If a bond pays interest twice a year, the annual payment would be divided by two. In this case, every six months you can expect $25. If the bond pays monthly, the exact same approach as above would be used, but the $50 would be divided by 12, since there are 12 months in a year.  In this case, $50 divided by 12 is $4.16, which means you would receive $4.16 monthly. You earn the interest only for the days you own the bond. If you buy a bond between interest payments, the market price will include the interest owed to the previous owner for the days he or she held the bond.',\n",
              " '– Japanese researchers have added to the \"Nazca line\" mystery by uncovering yet another ancient geoglyph in Peru, the Smithsonian reports. The 98-foot-long bas-relief appears to depict a mythological creature that\\'s sticking out its tongue, has many legs, and a body covered in spots, per a press release. What\\'s it all about? Interpretations of Peruvian geoglyphs have varied, but the researchers, Masato Sakai and Jorge Olano, suggest this one is linked to ancient pilgrimages to a ceremonial center. Called Cahuachi, the Nazca center existed between about 1 AD and 500 AD in the Central Andes\\' coastal area. In 2011, Sakai and Olano found another geoglyph near the path to Cahuachi showing \"anthropomorphic figures\" in \"a scene of decapitation,\" they say. The latest find was made by pulling up dark-colored surface stones to reveal \"the underlying whitish ground\" and piling the stones in the shape of the animal, they explain. \"This is a characteristic technique of geoglyphs and [the find] may date back to 2,000 to 2,500 years ago,\" says Sakai, per Andina. \"Taking into account there is an ancient path, between the two geoglyphs, heading to the Cahuachi ceremonial site, we might say the figures are linked to a pilgrimage way to such religious place.\" The Nazca lines were once thought of as calendars, but prevailing theory says they led to rituals performed for water and crop fertility, National Geographic reports. Their visibility from the air has led to some to say extra-terrestrials were involved, notes Ancient Origins.',\n",
              " \"This was one of the funniest and greatest sitcom to hit national television. Its unfortunate that the show is not placed amongst great sitcoms where it truly belongs. The actors did a superb job and seasons one thru six were the show at its peak point. Although season seven was not as great when compared to the previous six, it was still funny. Season 8 was the real problem kicked in. Without Topher grace or Ashton Kutcher the show simply fell apart. Not too say, the other actors weren't great if any of 2 main characters had left such as Danny Masterson, Wilder Valderamma Kurtwood Smith, Debra Jo Rupp, Mila Kunis and Laura Prepon ( Don Starks and tommy Chong are great too) left the show it would have the same affect. And the inclusion of Randy ( Josh Meyers) didn't help either because he was not well received by the shows fans. I believe if the show ended a year ago it would have certainly gone down in history as one of the sitcom greats. Season 8 was a little dull but the finale was excellent.

              " '– This surely ranks among the more unexpected studies: Vampires are real, and they have a fear—\"of Coming out of the Coffin to Social Workers and Helping Professionals,\" as the study\\'s title reads in part. The study, published in the journal Critical Social Work, isn\\'t talking about \"lifestyle\" vampires, who might wear fake fangs or don a black cape, but rather true vampirism, which \"centers on claims of needing extra energy\"—that would be blood—\"regularly in order to sustain health.\" DJ Williams, who\\'s studied self-identified vampires for almost a decade, interviewed 11 individuals from the US and South Africa who say they need to drink others\\' blood for this reason, reports Reuters. After quizzing them about their psychiatric backgrounds, careers, and social lives, he found them much like everyone else. Though some have a habit of cutting into the chests of willing donors to ingest a small amount of blood—a non-fatal procedure—they also \"work regular jobs and participate in the broader communities in which they live.\" One standout point, Williams says: they\\'re generally unwilling to visit a therapist or doctor though they may face \"stress, various health issues, relationship difficulties,\" and other struggles just like the rest of us. Many so-called vampires worry they\\'ll be labeled a psychopath, or \"perhaps wicked, and not competent to perform in typical social roles, such as parenting,\" the study notes. Real vampires feel they had no choice about their identity, with some saying they wish they were free of their condition. \"Most vampires believe they were born that way; they don\\'t choose this,\" Williams tells Reuters, and his study encourages \"helping professionals ... to become more aware of their own social and cultural positioning so that these do not unintentionally harm clients whose backgrounds and beliefs differ.\" Curious how many vampires walk among us? Williams suspects there are thousands. (Vampire burials have been found in Poland.)',\n",
              " \"An example of an negative review: I am offended as both an Italian (from New York!) and as a customer that this restaurant exists.   I should have seen the red flags fly when the restaurant had only one table and the football game on the TV on a Saturday night. Foolish me.   It started out decent enough, although for an empty restaurant the service was painfully slow. Should it really take 10 minutes to bring 2 glasses of wine? The bread and red pepper dipping sauce was fine enough, not amazing but it was tasty. We lorded the eggplant rollatini for an appetizer. They should really note how excessively large their portions are. Our appetizer could have easily been dinner for two, and no, that is not a selling point. It was lukewarm, but again, tasty enough. The marinara was basically crushed tomatoes saturated in garlic salt with some basil thrown in. My grandmother is rolling in her grave as I write this, I'm sure.  Then came the worst part - the entrees. Two heaping bowls of sauce came out. Somewhere in there was my chicken and shrimp carbonara and my boyfriend's lobster ravioli. There had to have been at least 4 cups of store-bought sauce in each bowl. Within a few bites, the sauce had already started separating - how appetizing! The chicken in my carbonara was clearly frozen grilled chicken strips (perhaps Tyson?) that had an unpleasant after taste. The shrimp was slightly undercooked and still had their tails on. Normally, this would be fine, but when there is so much sauce to navigate through, grabbing onto a tail is not ideal. The peas were extremely over cooked and mushy. Somewhere was my bacon but that was too coated in sauce to find. My boyfriend's lobster ravioli was also overwhelmed with sauce. The dish also came with shrimp and scallops but again, the over abundance of sauce made differentiating between the two impossible.   To make the scene all the more sad, there was a man playing piano who for some reason decided to use the microphone to say he was going on a break. That would have been fine, however we were the only customers in the room at that point and only made the situation awkward.  I'm convinced the only reason their portions are so large is so they can charge $12+ for an entree without feeling guilty. $50 down the drain - I couldn't even stand the smell of the leftovers and promptly threw them away upon returning home.  To salvage what was left of our evening, we were forced to go to the grocery store and buy some Ben & Jerry's and beer - Two things we know we're getting our money's worth for.

Monday night changed all that with the CBS premiere of Supergirl, starring Melissa Benoist in the title role, and even Kryptonite couldn\\'t stop its momentum. The show set a record for this fall\\'s new-series premieres, pulling in 12.9 million viewers and achieving a 3.2 rating in Nielsen\\'s preliminary national estimates with adults ages 18 to 49, Deadline and Variety report. It helped that the show was preceded by The Big Bang Theory, which drew its own 15.9 million viewers and a 4.2 rating, and CBS is hoping the buzz won\\'t die down as it often does for other serialized shows as the weeks pass, Entertainment Weekly notes. If the series\\' immediate reception is a sign, viewers will stay riveted. Writing for the Los Angeles Times, Mary McNamara dubs the show \"super-charming\" and notes it fits neatly into the \"army of super-females (albeit still in an exclusively Caucasian palette)\" the network has been promoting via shows like The Good Wife and Madam Secretary. And in the Washington Post, Hank Stuever compiles a short list for \"everything it gets right,\" including the writing and editing, the casting (\"Benoist is one of those rare out-of-nowhere casting miracles\"), the show\\'s \"easy-breezy feminism,\" and its \"millennial wish-fulfillment.\" Calling the show a \"world ... light-years apart from, say, HBO\\'s Girls,\" he notes it\\'s \"one of the few shows on TV that seem to effortlessly embrace both the inhibitions and independence of someone who is proudly young, without a single scene that involves texting etiquette, swiping, or whining … about how hard her life is compared with everyone else\\'s.\"',\n",
              " 'And so he did. Boy, did he.\\nThe event, ostensibly an announcement of the president\\'s new pick for labour secretary, was anything but routine. New nominee Alexander Acosta wasn\\'t even in attendance - and it probably wasn\\'t a bad thing that he missed out, since he quickly became an afterthought to the 76-minute free-form scrum that ensued.\\nSo much for White House message discipline. Instead, it was Trump being Trump. The off-the-cuff style got him elected president, of course, so perhaps it\\'s how he will reboot his four-week-old (!) presidency.  Donald Trump was off the leash - just the way he seems to like it.\\nHere are some of the highlights.\\nThursday\\'s press conference was Trump v the Media, round eleventy-billion.\\nMr Trump said mainstream journalists were the voice of a \"broken system\" of special interests that he is challenging - which can only be catnip for his base and a way of insulating himself against the recent barrage of negative stories.\\nWhen pressed on the simmering scandal over former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn\\'s contacts with Russia and how the White House handled them, the president parried and then went after \"dishonest\" reporters who should be \"ashamed\" about inaccurate reporting based on illegal leaks (the president did not acknowledge the apparent contradiction in such a statement).\\nHe blamed reporters for the New York Times and Wall Street Journal for not directly contacting him before running unflattering stories, as though they had his personal mobile number.\\nHe even engaged in a bit of presidential concern-trolling, telling a CNN reporter his network would \"do much better by being different\".\\n\"I started off today by saying that it\\'s so important to the public to get an honest press,\" Mr Trump continued. \"The public doesn\\'t believe you people anymore. Now, maybe I had something to do with that. I don\\'t know. But they don\\'t believe you.\"\\nMr Trump seemed to be at his happiest in this back-and-forth with hostile reporters over whether or not the media are honest - and with good reason. While journalists care deeply about the reputation of their profession, the general public probably views it as so much navel-gazing.\\nEvery minute debating the impartiality and truthfulness of the press is a battle fought on terrain friendly to the president.\\nMr Trump has a habit of making statements that have, shall we say, a sometimes distant relationship with reality. He often couches the remarks in phrases like \"I\\'ve heard\", \"people are saying\", or \"I guess\".\\nSuch was the case when he turned once again - in the scripted portion of his press conference, no less - to the size of his Electoral College victory last November.\\nIn a bit of a twist, however, a reporter from NBC, Peter Alexander, called him on it minutes later.\\nHe said that Barack Obama and Bill Clinton posted bigger margins of victory. Mr Trump replied that he was referring to Republican presidents.\\nAlexander countered that George HW Bush had a bigger win, too.\\n\"Why should Americans trust you when you accuse the information they\\'ve received as being fake, when you provide information that\\'s not accurate?\" he asked.\\nTrump replied that it was information he \"was given\" and had \"seen around\", before saying that it was still a \"very substantial victory\" - a claim much more difficult to disprove.\\nPresident Trump, like Candidate Trump, has seemed invulnerable to fact-checkers, perhaps in part because he\\'s moved on to a hundred different topics before the media watchdogs can catch up.\\nThursday, for at least a brief moment, was different.\\nThe event on Thursday was billed as a press conference, but for the first half-hour it seemed more like an unpolished mid-day State of Union address. It was a chance for the president to talk over the gathered heads of the journalists in remarks broadcast on three of the four major US commercial networks and all the cable news outlets.\\nHe spoke about the jobs he\\'s brought back to the US - anecdotal and small-bore though they may be. He spoke of \"productive talks\" he\\'s had with world leaders and the request he\\'s made for his military to come up with a plan to defeat the so-called Islamic state.\\nHe cited executive actions withdrawing from the Trans-Pacific Partnership and cutting back on government regulations. He boasted of task forces created, councils formed and agency co-ordination instructed.\\nAnd he touted his immigration efforts - a key piece of which is currently suspended pending court review.\\n\"This last month has represented an unprecedented degree of action on behalf of the great citizens of our country,\" Mr Trump asserted again. \"And we have not even started the big work yet.\"\\nThat last part is definitely true. While the Trump administration has seemed to be in a flurry of activity, legislatively there has been relatively little accomplished. Within the first four weeks of his presidency, Mr Obama had signed into law a measure increasing protection for women\\'s wages in the workplace and a massive economic stimulus bill that included more than $800bn in new federal spending.\\nAfter four weeks, Mr Trump still has 98% of his presidency ahead of him. The start has been rocky, and less accomplished than he says, but the jury is still out.\\nOne of the criticisms that seems to irk Mr Trump the most is that his presidency has been beset by \"chaos\" and mismanagement.\\nMr Trump lays part of the blame at the feet of Democrats, whom he says have been slow to approve his top-level cabinet appointments.\\nWhile part of this assuredly true, as Democrats slow-walked several of his nominees, others have been tardy because there were delays in submitting vetting paperwork or in the announcement of the nominations.\\nPerhaps of greater cause for concern is the lack of lower-level appointments announced. In key departments like state and treasury, the under-secretary slots remain largely unfilled.\\nThen there\\'s the ongoing palace intrigue within the White House, which Mr Trump glossed over. He said that his chief of staff, Reince Priebus, is \"working so hard just putting out fires\" - but some of those fires are coming from within his own administration.\\nIn one Washington Post story, an unnamed White House official said Priebus had to \"become more competent\". There\\'s talk of rival factions within the Trump team, with pragmatists like Priebus squared off against longtime Trump true-believers like Steve Bannon and Stephen Miller.\\nWhen asked by the BBC\\'s Jon Sopel about one of the most-cited example of White House chaos - the confusion surrounding the administration\\'s rollout of the Mr Trump\\'s immigration order - the president was defiant.\\n\"We had a very smooth rollout of the travel ban,\" he said. \"But we had a bad court.\"\\nThe court decisions Mr Trump was apparently referencing - either by the Seattle judge who suspended implementation of the ban or the appellate court that upheld the injunction - came well after the first few unruly days of implementation, however, when US immigration officials seemed uncertain of how to apply the broadly worded order.\\nPerhaps \"chaos\" is too strong a word, but \"smooth\" is downplaying the confusion, particularly for permanent US residents from Iran, Iraq and other targeted nations who were left wondering whether they could safely enter the US.\\nAfter berating a CNN reporter, calling the BBC\\'s Jon Sopel a \"real beauty\" and repeatedly telling a Jewish reporter asking about anti-Semitism to be quiet, Mr Trump finally found a question he liked - from an independent reporter named Kyle Mazza.\\n\"Can you tell us all the things Melania does for the country?\" he asked, referring to the president\\'s wife.\\n\"That is what I call a nice question,\" Mr Trump responded, before extolling the virtues of the first lady.\\n\"I\\'ve known her for a long time,\" he said. \"She was a very successful person. She was a very successful model. She did really well.\"\\nMr Trump had been criticised for only calling on friendly reporters over the course of the last three press availabilities - all joint appearances with foreign leaders where a total of six questions from US journalists were permitted. Mr Trump chose conservative news outlets like Townhall, the Daily Caller and Newsmax over traditional mainstream media reporters.\\nOn Thursday, however, Mr Trump took the media\\'s best shot - although he carped about how he\\'d be portrayed as \"ranting and raving\" in the subsequent coverage.\\nHe may not have ranted and raved, but it was a most unusual press conference nonetheless.',\n",

              " 'Dozens of children called for freedom, held anti-government signs and criticized President Bashar al-Assad in at least two Syrian cities on Sunday, a day before al-Assad planned to make another speech to the unsettled nation. In a video posted on YouTube, showing a demonstration the cameraman claims took place Sunday in the Damascus suburb of Kaboon, dozens of mostly young people walk down a street brandishing signs, chanting and in some cases wearing party hats with messages on them. They are joined by a handful of adults, including one man who puts a boy on his shoulders as they march. Another YouTube video, purportedly from the coastal city of Latakia, shows a group of young boys clapping and voicing anti-government sentiments. One boy leads the chants, with no adults visible. The repeated phrases range from the patriotic \"Long live Syria\" to others targeting Syria\\'s leader with slogans like \"Bashar al-Assad go away\" and \"The people need the fall of the regime.\" Middle East, North Africa: Unrest country by country. An opposition activist, who spoke to CNN from Syria on condition of anonymity, said that such demonstrations have become a daily ritual in the Middle Eastern country, with children embracing their parents\\' politics and following their lead in voicing their views publicly. Parents and teachers are often nearby in these protests, which typically happen in neighborhoods near homes or schools, the activist claimed. CNN cannot independently verify the authenticity of videos. The network has not been allowed into Syria to cover the unrest and draws from social media and interviews with witnesses on the ground there to inform its reporting. There was no indication of violence Sunday, unlike what\\'s been reported during dozens of other protests that have erupted since the mid-March arrest of teens for writing anti-government graffiti in Daraa. More than 1,100 people may have died in subsequent unrest across Syria, according to the human rights activist group Amnesty International. Critics have accused forces loyal to al-Assad of targeting defenseless demonstrators and hindering outside help for those in need. The Syrian government has consistently blamed the protest casualties on \"armed gangs.\" Al-Assad on Monday afternoon will deliver his third speech in recent months about the situation in Syria, according to the official SANA news agency. International pressure against the Damascus government has steadily grown, with calls from political leaders in the United States, Europe and elsewhere criticizing the perceived government clampdown on demonstrators. Beatrice Megevand-Roggo, the Red Cross\\' director for the Near East and Middle East, said in an interview posted last month on the group\\'s website that a lack of information and access has greatly hindered humanitarian assistance to Syria. The head of her group, International Committee of the Red Cross President Jakob Kellenberger, will arrive in the Syrian capital on Sunday night, the organization announced via Twitter. He plans to \"discuss the humanitarian situation\" and the role of the Red Cross with Syrian authorities, the nonprofit group said. Kellenberger\\'s visit comes two days after another high-profile activist -- actress and U.N. goodwill ambassador Angelina Jolie -- met with Syrian refugees in Turkey and drew attention to the anguish faced by families affected by the violence and reported government crackdown. The Turkish government said Saturday more than 10,100 Syrians have crossed the border. About 3,000 more were huddled on the Syrian border near Badama, eyewitness Jameel Saib told CNN Saturday. The refugees that Jolie visited are living in four camps managed by Turkey and the Turkish Red Crescent, reports the U.N.\\'s refugee agency. \"The people in this camp have fled in fear for their lives, and many told me they were distraught about the safety of loved ones still in Syria,\" Jolie said, according to the U.N. group.

              " 'It should come as no shock to you when I say that Alone in the Dark is a crappy movie. To put it bluntly, it\\'s as if a dung monster defecated, ate the result, and then vomited. The final product would still outshine this movie.\\n\\nSeemingly based on an ancient (!) Atari video game, the movie has something or other to do with a portal to the bowels of the earth, the unleashing of demons, and ancient civilizations. Something about there being two worlds, that of darkness and that of light. (Guess which one\\'s ours.) Oh, and 10,000 years ago a really super-duper advanced civilization opened the portal, demons came over and had a blast, then wiped out the civilization. Which is why we\\'ve never heard of them, conveniently enough.\\n\\nChristian Slater, perhaps pining for the days of Heathers and Pump up the Volume, plays Edward Carnby, a paranormal researcher to whom Something Bad happened when he was 10 years old. He\\'s hot on the trail of one of the artifacts of said advanced civilization. Carnby used to be part of a secret institution called 713, which has been trying to figure out what happened to that long-ago civilization. But Carnby believed he wasn\\'t going to be able to find the answers he sought, so he left the group.\\n\\nBut see, these beasties are out, and they get their prey in varying ways, such as gutting them, splitting them down the middle, implanting neurological control devices in them, or just turning them into killing zombies. Yes, it\\'s another zombie movie.\\n\\nThat\\'s about as distilled I can make the plot. It\\'s pretty convoluted and incomprehensible. In similar movies, one might see the intrepid researcher/adventurer figure things out a step at a time, and when we the audience are mentally with the researcher, it\\'s a lot of fun. But when the scenes shift from attack to attack with no perspective or context... not so much fun.\\n\\nThe acting is dreadful, save for Slater, who (although he almost seems embarrassed to be in the movie) showed he was capable of carrying the acting load. He had to; get this - Tara Reid is cast as a museum curator! Honest to goodness, I thought I\\'d seen the casting of a lifetime when Denise Richards was cast as a nuclear physicist in Tomorrow Never Dies. But Reid here matches Richards, crappy emoting for crappy emoting. Hightlights include Reid pronouncing \"Newfoundland\" as \"New Fownd Land,\" Reid delivering most of her lines in a dazed, throaty monotone (kinda like she\\'d been on an all-night bender for the past week before filming), Reid - a museum curator, mind you - spending a lot of the movie in a midriff-bearing top and hip-hugger jeans. Oh yeah, she was as believable as Jessica Simpson giving stock quotes. Oh, why must the pretty ones be so dumb? (Note: I don\\'t think Tara Reid\\'s all that good looking. She looks like she\\'s in perpetual need of food.) Almost everyone else in the cast is completely forgettable, except perhaps for Steven Dorff, who played Burke, one of the leaders of 713. Dorff\\'s character wasn\\'t terribly well developed, but nothing in the movie was, from the sets to the characters to Tara Reid. But I digress.\\n\\nAnyway, the perplexing and utterly preposterous storyline is tough enough to follow with the film moving at such a breakneck pace, but director Uwe Boll tosses in a pounding, mind-deadening soundtrack; it\\'s so loud you can\\'t hear what the actors are saying in some of the scenes! That can\\'t be right. Given the acting level, however, perhaps thanks are in order to Mr. Boll.\\n\\nOh, and a fun note. The opening moments of the movie include narration... of the words that are crawling across the screen at the same time. Remember the first Star Wars? You heard that now-familiar Star Wars theme while the prologue crawled. There was surely no need for narration; why do I need some doofus to read what\\'s on the screen for me? Were the producers simply looking out for blind people? Maybe that also explains why the soundtrack was so loud - they were also looking out for hard-of-hearing people. Also, the narrator inexplicably had a lisp for the first few lines of the crawl - then lost it. Bizarre.\\n\\nAlone in the Dark is a loud, dopey mishmash of dreadful acting, an incoherent script, and ham-handed directing. Hardly a note rings true. There\\'s so much chaos that the audience simply gives up caring about the characters and roots for their demise. Even in the dark, the demonic creatures seem cooler and much more developed by comparison.\\n\\nIronically, since there were only three other people in the theater, I watched this Alone in the Dark. I wonder if Uwe Boll planned it that way? I can\\'t quite give this the lowest rating, because I had low hopes for it to begin with - and because it never grabbed me enough for me to get worked up about it. It\\'s atrocious, although Slater redeems himself a tiny bit.',\n",
              " \"If you wish to make butterfly cakes, you will need to prepare some fairy cakes first. You will also need to prepare some buttercream icing. Once the cakes have cooled, you can begin turning your fairy cakes into butterfly cakes.  To make the base cakes, refer to the section on making fairy cakes. To prepare some buttercream icing, refer to the section on making buttercream icing. Using a serrated knife, cut part of the dome off on each cake. You want to angle the knife slightly while you cut, so that you are creating a small groove in each cake. You will be filling this groove with buttercream icing later. Your butterfly cakes will need some wings. You can create wings for your cakes by cutting each dome in half, creating little half-domes. You will need to fill the grooves you made earlier in your cakes with buttercream icing. Not only does this give the cakes extra flavour, but it also helps secure the wings. You can fill the grooves with icing either by spreading icing into them with a knife, or by piping icing into them using a decorating bag. If you do not have a decorating bag, you can make your own by filling a plastic bag with buttercream icing and cutting the corner off. To prevent the icing from squishing out the opposite way and getting all over your hands, secure the open part of the bag either by knotting it or by wrapping a rubber band around it. At this point, you can add the wings, or you can make the butterfly cakes more colourful and flavourful by dding a dollop of lemon curd or jam. Simply spoon a little bit of lemon curd or jam right right in the centre of each cake. This can be the body of the butterfly. Each butterfly cake gets two half-dome wings. Place the wings on top of the buttercream and to either side of the dollop of curd or jam. Apply gentle pressure. You want them to stick, but you don't want them to be completely submerged in the icing. The parts that were originally the top of the cakes should be facing each other, and the parts that were in the groove should be facing out. The flat edge, created from when you cut the wings in half, should be in the buttercream. At this point, you can leave your butterfly cakes as they are, or you can add some variety with icing sugar. To do this, simply dust some sifted icing sugar on top of each cake. Make sure to get the wings! You can use coloured sugar or hundreds and thousands instead of icing sugar. This will make the butterfly cakes more colourful.\",\n",
              " '– Hillary Clinton has spent $61 million on TV ads in two months, a hefty sum that does not include $43 million spent by pro-Clinton groups. That\\'s exactly $104 million more than Donald Trump. With less than three months until the election, the Republican candidate has yet to spend a dollar on TV ads, though pro-Trump groups have contributed $12.4 million. Even Green Party candidate Jill Stein has spent more, about $189,000, while Libertarian Gary Johnson has spent $15,000, reports NBC News. If Trump were already well ahead, keeping money in the bank might make sense. But an NBC weekly national poll finds he\\'s nine points behind Clinton, 50% to 41%, with a slightly higher unfavorability rating of 64% compared to Clinton\\'s 59%.

Philip Bump at the Washington Post says it\\'s \"a question that defies a logical answer.\" He adds Trump\\'s lack of spending is particularly strange because \"the longer the Trump campaign waits to reserve ad time, the less ad time exists to buy and the more ads cost\" since candidates in House and Senate races are also in the mix. \"Political scientists, you now have an amazing case study on your hands,\" as NBC puts it.',\n",

              " \"The amount a person earns during their first ten years in the work force has a significant influence on their earning potential over their entire lifetime, new research has found. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York studied the period 1978 to 2010 and has concluded that a good start is vital to ensuring a better salary further down the line. 'Across the board, the bulk of earnings growth happens during the first decade,' states the paper written by economists Fatih Guvenen, Fatih Karahan, Serdar Ozkan and Jae Song. The Fed research isn't good news for the millions of millennials who entered the workforce after the economic downturn in 2007 and who's earning potential has got off to a slow start as a result. The research isn't good news for the millions of millennials who entered the workforce after the economic downturn of 2007 and who's earning potential has got off to a slow start as a result. From 2007 until the pace of hiring picked up last year, the jobless rates for millennials topped other age groups, even among those with freshly earned college and advanced degrees. Many were forced to enter the workforce in lower-wage jobs and will have a hard time catching up later in their careers. A steep learning curve early in ones career means that workers should be looking to increase their salary also, said Guvenen, an economics professor at the University of Minnesota. 'At 25, I choose a job that allows me to learn valuable skills,' Guvenen told the Washington Post. 'I'm investing in my future, and my employer is allowing me to invest in my future. Soon, I'm producing more for my employer - and my employer is paying me more.' The amount a person earns during their first ten years in the work force has a significant influence on their earning potential over their entire lifetime, new research from the Fed has found. Unfortunately for the average person earnings growth starts to stagnate after the first 10 years of work. The researchers found that the average earnings growth for the 35-to-55 age group was zero, with only the wealthiest workers sustaining increases throughout their careers.

              " \"Powdered alcohol hasn't even arrived in stores yet, but states already are moving to ban the product touted by its inventor as an easy way to mix a drink on the go. Colorado is the latest state considering prohibiting 'Palcohol' amid concern it will increase underage drinking. The product is marketed as an ounce of rum or vodka in powdered form, which is then added to water. Each serving is the equivalent of a shot of liquor, according to Lipsmark, the company that owns Palcohol. Scroll down for video. Legislators in five states have already outlawed Palcohol before its planned launch next year. The controversial product is awaiting approval by the Food and Drug Administration before it can launch. 'I think being proactive and jumping out in front of the problem is probably the right thing to do,' said Chris Johnson, executive director of the County Sheriffs of Colorado. 'It really doesn't have any place in our society, powered alcohol. We have enough problems with the liquid kind.' Johnson said he fears powdered alcohol will make it easier for children to 'sprinkle it on top of their Wheaties for breakfast' and increase the potential for alcohol poisoning. 'It can be a very dangerous thing,' he said. The company's website notes various instances where they argue the product would be convenient, including on flights and as an antiseptic on remote locations. Palcohol's creator, Mark Phillips, said he thought of the idea because it would be easier to carry powder for a drink during a long hike or other outdoor activities. Alaska, Delaware, Louisiana, South Carolina and Vermont already have banned powdered alcohol, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Minnesota, Ohio, and New York also are considering bans, the organization said. Colorado Republican JoAnn Windholz is planning to introduce a ban on Palcohol in her home state. In a video posted on the company's website, Phillips dismisses the concerns about underage drinking, noting the product would be sold only at liquor stores to people 21 and older. In the video, he also argues it would be impractical for people to snort the powder, as some critics fear, because it would be painful to do and the amount of powder in a package fills about half a glass tumbler. The company doesn't expect Palcohol will be available in stores until spring 2015 at the earliest. They're still waiting for labeling approval from the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau. The Food and Drug Administration said it does not have a legal basis to block the product after examining the non-alcoholic ingredients in the powder. Lynne Barbour, director of communications for Palcohol, said states should control the product instead of banning it. 'We believe it should be regulated and taxed,' she said in an email. In addition to making Palcohol available as powdered rum and vodka, the company plans four cocktail varieties — Cosmopolitan, Mojito, Lemon Drop, and Powderita. Republican Rep. JoAnn Windholz is sponsoring a bill to ban powdered alcohol in Colorado during the legislative session that begins next month. She said it's prudent for states to ban the product until they know how it can affect people if it happens to be stronger than liquid alcohol — another concern Phillips contends is unfounded. Windholz said states should make sure they have a regulatory system in place before allowing powdered alcohol to be sold. 'It can be taken into schools, it can be taken into sports (events), Broncos games, whatever,' she said.\",\n",

That strange finding comes out of a new analysis in the journal Pain, which looked at medical studies going back to 1990. It turns out that people who take the sham medication in studies today report more pain relief than those who took them in studies 25 years ago, say researchers out of McGill University in a press release. The scientists theorize that people today have higher expectations about drugs, and when they\\'re participating in a big, fancy study—studies have grown in scope over the last two decades—they expect to feel better. It\\'s no mere quirk, as Nature explains. To get their drugs approved, manufacturers need to show that they outperform placebos, and the improved placebo performance is making it harder to do that. \"The data suggest that longer and larger trials are associated with bigger placebo responses,\" says the author of the paper. \"This, in turn, tends to result in the failure of those trials—since it makes it harder for pharmaceutical companies to prove that the drug being tested is more effective than treatment with a placebo.\" Forbes notes that the finding applies only to the US, and not to other countries studied. One theory on why: The US allows drug companies to advertise directly to consumers, perhaps again raising those aforementioned expectations.

To assess the totality of the evidence testing the null hypothesis that LES exposure (versus sugars or unsweetened alternatives) has no effect on EI or BW, we conducted a systematic review of relevant studies in animals and humans consuming LES with ad libitum access to food energy. In 62 of 90 animal studies exposure to LES did not affect or decreased BW. Of 28 reporting increased BW, 19 compared LES with glucose exposure using a specific ‘learning’ paradigm. Twelve prospective cohort studies in humans reported inconsistent associations between LES use and body mass index (−0.002 kg m − 2 per year, 95% confidence interval (CI) −0.009 to 0.005). Meta-analysis of short-term randomized controlled trials (129 comparisons) showed reduced total EI for LES versus sugar-sweetened food or beverage consumption before an ad libitum meal (−94 kcal, 95% CI −122 to −66), with no difference versus water (−2 kcal, 95% CI −30 to 26). This was consistent with EI results from sustained intervention randomized controlled trials (10 comparisons). Meta-analysis of sustained intervention randomized controlled trials (4 weeks to 40 months) showed that consumption of LES versus sugar led to relatively reduced BW (nine comparisons; −1.35 kg, 95% CI –2.28 to −0.42), and a similar relative reduction in BW versus water (three comparisons; −1.24 kg, 95% CI –2.22 to −0.26). Most animal studies did not mimic LES consumption by humans, and reverse causation may influence the results of prospective cohort studies. The preponderance of evidence from all human randomized controlled trials indicates that LES do not increase EI or BW, whether compared with caloric or non-caloric (for example, water) control conditions. Overall, the balance of evidence indicates that use of LES in place of sugar, in children and adults, leads to reduced EI and BW, and possibly also when compared with water. \\n  \\n Top of page Introduction Low-energy sweeteners (LES), such as acesulfame-K, aspartame, saccharin, stevia and sucralose are consumed throughout the world.1 The history of their use has been accompanied by debate and disagreements, not least about their potential nutritional impact. The use of LES to replace or partially replace added sugar in foods and beverages might well be expected to reduce energy intake (EI),2, 3, 4 yet over recent years there has been widely reported speculation that consumption of LES might increase the risk of becoming overweight and obese.5, 6, 7 Studies covertly manipulating energy density show higher EI after consumption of a reduced-energy food or beverage, but that the degree of energy ‘compensation’ is variable.8 Crucially, energy compensation is usually lower than the difference in energy content of the comparison foods/beverages, seemingly being lowest of all for liquids.8 This suggests that consuming LES in place of sugar-sweetened products should reduce overall EI, and particularly so for consumption of beverages, the most popular vehicles for LES.1 The question also arises whether the presence of LES in beverages affects appetite and EI relative to plain water.1, 9 Although the imprecise control of short-term energy balance predicts that LES consumption should help reduce EI and therefore reduce risk of overweight and obesity,3, 10 it is possible that, as consumed in everyday life, other effects of LES balance or even outweigh the energy dilution effect. For example, a low calorie or ‘diet’ label may cause the consumer to eat a larger portion of the product or eat more of accompanying foods in the meal, or eat more later.11, 12, 13, 14 More simply, adding sweetness to a product may increase intake owing to increased palatability.15, 16 Or, by ‘uncoupling’ the relationship between sweetness and energy content, the consumption of LES may undermine the usefulness of sweetness as a cue in the control of energy balance.5, 17, 18, 19, 20 The effects of LES consumption on EI and body weight (BW) have been the subject of many studies over the past 30 years; nonetheless there is no clear consensus about this body of evidence. Taken together, a number of narrative reviews1, 2, 3, 4, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25 and systematic reviews of some types of studies26, 27, 28, 29, 30 lead to the consistent but guarded conclusion that substitution of LES for sugar, especially in beverages, can help reduce EI, but that fully convincing evidence for longer-term beneficial effects is lacking. Our principle aim was, therefore, to bring together the totality of evidence to test the primary (null) hypotheses that LES consumption per se or as a replacement for caloric sweeteners in foods or beverages has no effect on EI or BW outcomes in adults or children. We conducted systematic reviews of animal, human observational and human intervention studies providing information on LES consumption and EI and/or BW. We included animal studies particularly because findings from a subset of animal studies appear to suggest that consumption of LES might increase risk of BW gain.19 Within the human intervention studies we furthermore sought to test a secondary (null) hypothesis that the effects of consumption of LES beverages on EI and BW do not differ from the effects of consumption of water. \\n  \\n Top of page Materials and methods A systematic search of the literature was undertaken to identify studies in humans and animals that assessed the effects of consumption of LES on EI and/or BW and/or body mass index (BMI). LES were defined as ingredients contributing negligible energy to products to achieve a sweetness similar in comparison with caloric sweeteners. Thus LES include intense sweeteners and non-metabolized sugars but exclude most sugar alcohols (see Supplementary Information for full definition and examples). We use ‘sugars’ to refer to caloric sweeteners, usually sucrose. The databases of MEDLINE and EMBASE via OVID interface and Web of Science were searched from their inception to 01 February 2015, using a combination of MeSH terms and key word terms to identify research addressing the relevant combinations of exposures (sweetener types) and outcomes (describing food or EI, anthropometric measures or changes in these). No restrictions were applied regarding language or dates. This search generated 5506 articles, which were processed as summarised in Figure 1. Medline search terms and further details of our methods are provided in the Supplementary Information. Figure 1. Flow of information through the different phases of the systematic review. Full figure and legend (118 K ) \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n Top of page Discussion Table 2 summaries the results of this review. It shows that the weight of the evidence indicates decreased EI and BW with consumption of LES relative to sugar. Furthermore, LES do not appear to increase EI, and in human interventions studies tend to lead to a relatively decreased BW, even compared with consumption of water in the groups tested. These findings are consistently contrary to the concern that has been raised by some authors5, 6, 7 that consumption of LES may increase risk of becoming overweight and obese. The results in favour of a benefit of LES use in BW management come primarily from a substantial number of short-term and sustained intervention studies testing human participants, which can be reasonably said to rank above observational studies and animal studies as sources of evidence for informing health-care decisions, including dietary recommendations. In any case, close examination of the totality of the evidence including that from observational and animal studies does not contradict the conclusion that LES use is helpful, or at least neutral, with respect to BW control. Table 2 - Summary of the results of the review. Full table \\n  \\n A recent systematic review and meta-analysis of the evidence from prospective cohort and sustained intervention studies on LES and BW and composition193 differs from ours in the studies included and excluded for both sources of evidence (see Supplementary Tables S19 and S20 for further details), and in not considering the evidence from short-term intervention studies and animal studies, or the specific comparison with water. The authors, nevertheless, reach similar conclusions to us. They state that ‘substituting LCS (low-calorie sweeteners) options for their regular-calorie versions results in modest BW loss, and may be a useful dietary tool to improve compliance with BW loss or BW maintenance plans’.193 We found that prospective associations between LES consumption and BW change were not consistent across the literature, with beneficial and adverse associations of LES use with BW reported by similar numbers of studies. This could be due to differences in the populations studied and/or the extent to which specific confounding factors were accounted for, chance findings in small studies and publication bias. A major confounder may be the BW control history and strategies used in the different populations. Thus, reverse causation cannot be ruled out. Notably, though, pooled analysis of the three largest studies showed a relative BW reduction for those consuming LES.100 Evidence from a large majority of animal studies favours reduced EI and BW gain or no effect of LES, although increases have been observed as well. A particular series of studies from one research group employing a specific procedure in rats has been widely cited in support of the suggestion that consumption of LES could lead to BW gain.194 The mechanism proposed for this is that LES consumption disrupts learning about the association between sweet taste and energy content. Arguably, however, the complexity of modern human diets is such that sweetness, with or without the inclusion of LES, does not reliably predict energy content foods.195 More likely, what is learned, if anything, is energy content (and its satiating effect) signalled by a configuration of taste, flavour, texture and other cues specific to individual foods. Therefore, whether or not LES are consumed will likely make little difference to the learned control of EI. In any case, without information from further control groups the interpretation of the results of these studies is ambiguous. Their relevance to human consumption of LES therefore remains to be demonstrated, especially in the light of the evidence from sustained human intervention studies of reduced BW with consumption of LES versus sugar, and LES versus water. In general, the animal studies did not mimic the use of LES by humans, either in amounts consumed or pattern of consumption. A variety of human and animal intervention studies provided data on the effects of consumption of LES-sweetened liquids versus water. The results indicate that the exposure to sweetness itself (without energy) is at least neutral in terms of impact on EI and energy balance, and possibly even helpful. This challenges the suggestion that exposure to sweetness itself is detrimental,6, 196, 197 perhaps because exposure to sweetness could help ‘establish and maintain’ a more generalised preference for sweet items.1 Acquired preferences for sweetness levels are relatively food-specific, although this is expressed against the background of a general innate liking for sweetness.198 On the other hand, evidence from studies of ‘sensory-specific satiety’ show that acute exposure to sweetness decreases subsequent desire for the same or other sweet (relative to non-sweet) items.199, 200, 201 Consistent with this, participants in the CHOICE trial receiving LES beverages specifically reduced consumption of dessert items relative to those receiving water.202 One possible interpretation is that access to LES satisfies a pre-existing desire for sweetness, rather than promoting it. A further result is that LES consumed in capsules either had no effect or reduced EI in short-term intervention studies (Figure 3), which argues against stimulation of gut receptors as a route by which LES might contribute toward increased EI and BW. The short-term intervention studies in humans measured the effects of consuming a fixed portion of a LES-sweetened beverage or food on free (ad libitum) consumption of other items presented in the test. In many of the animal studies the manipulated food was also the food that was consumed freely. For the most part the results of these two types of study lead to the equivalent conclusion, namely that there was little effect of the LES versus the equi-caloric control (usually water in the human studies, and unsweetened food in the animal studies) on EI or BW. An exception is increased EI and BW gain in a small number of studies in which saccharin was added to moistened or fat-enriched diets, perhaps owing to saccharin increasing the palatability of these diets. This context differs from the consumption of LES in the human diet, where LES usually replace sugars in foods and beverages.1 Furthermore, as discussed above, there is no substantive evidence that consuming LES-sweetened products increases EI or BW in humans. Our analysis of short-term intervention studies comparing LES with water supports Daniels and Popkin’s27 conclusion that these studies are ‘relatively consistent and found no impact on EI among adults’ (p 505). Their review of a subset of the studies we included found that consumption of water versus LES-sweetened beverages led to essentially no change (1.3% reduction) in EI in adults and a 6.7% reduction in children. Nevertheless, our meta-analysis of three sustained intervention studies with a water comparison finds that LES consumption leads to somewhat reduced BW relative to consumption of water.179, 184, 185 As well as an effect via ‘sensory-specific satiety’ (above), this perhaps suggests an advantage for LES in respect of dietary compliance, in that LES beverages may be preferred to water.179 It would seem appropriate therefore to consider, particularly for consumers already accustomed to sweetened beverages, whether promotion of LES or water as an alternative holds greatest public health effectiveness.203 The answer should come from further appropriately designed intervention studies and perhaps further analyses of already completed trials where participants had free choice of water versus LES beverages.187 Both short-term and sustained intervention studies in humans show LES consumption reduces ad libitum EI. However, possibly for several reasons, short-term studies may underestimate the degree of energy compensation that occurs in response to energy dilution. This is consistent with the finding that BW differences observed in sustained intervention studies are often much smaller that would be the case if no compensation had occurred.182 Nonetheless, sustained studies repeatedly find effects in favour of LES consumption reducing BW relative to sugar consumption, showing that compensation is incomplete. Of course, the same argument and many of the same data are used in making the case that consumption of sugar-sweetened products, and particularly sugar-sweetened-beverages, increase risk of overweight and obesity.182, 204, 205 \\n  \\n Top of page Conclusions We found a considerable weight of evidence in favour of consumption of LES in place of sugar as helpful in reducing relative EI and BW, with no evidence from the many acute and sustained intervention studies in humans that LES increase EI. Importantly, the effects of LES-sweetened beverages on BW also appear neutral relative to water, or even beneficial in some contexts. A selection of animal and observational studies is often cited as the primary basis for strong assertions that LES are a contributing factor toward risk of overeating and obesity.5 In contrast, the present review of a large and systematically identified body of evidence from human intervention studies, with varying designs, settings and populations (including children and adults, males and females, and lean, overweight and obese groups), provide no support for that view. The question then is whether those hypotheses should be rejected or whether, as seems unlikely, the relevant human intervention studies are consistently flawed in a way that leads, in most cases, to exactly the opposite outcome. Commentaries on LES and energy balance frequently suggest that further research is needed, but stop short of proposing any specific new hypothesis to test or new study designs. Although no single study by itself is conclusive, the correspondence of results from the studies reviewed here gives no reason to expect another similar study would yield remarkably different results. Continued selective citation and extrapolation from observational and animal studies on this topic is also likely to be of limited value. Mattes & Popkin1 concluded that replacement of sugar by LES has ‘the potential to aid in BW management, but whether they will be used in this way is uncertain’ (p 10). This seems a reasonable conclusion from the literature, and shifts the issue from whether LES are ‘good’ or ‘bad,’ and re-focuses it on the question of how they are best used in practice to help in the achievement of specific public health goals, such as the reduction of intakes of free sugars and energy. \\n  \\n Top of page Conflict of interest Peter J Rogers has received grants from Sugar Nutrition, UK in support of research on the effects of sugar on human appetite.

These same companies are at it again, not only providing the backing for another study extolling the virtues of diet drinks, but also — according to new reports — directly paying money to the researchers involved. \\n  \\n The latest research to be criticized over this apparent conflict of interest comes from the International Journal of Obesity, which recently published a review [PDF] of existing scientific research on the link between “low-energy sweetener consumption” and “energy intake and body weight.” \\n  \\n The study does disclose that it was funded, in part, by the International Life Sciences Institute — Europe, a group whose board of directors features not just a bunch of heavily credentialed academics, but also executives from Coca-Cola, Nestlé, PepsiCo, Mars, and Unilever. In fact, while there are some 19 people on the ILSI Europe board, three out of five of its officers are representing the food industry. \\n  \\n Additionally, one of the researchers himself is an employee of ILSI Europe, while the study’s lead author previously received research funding from a group called “Sugar Nutrition, UK,” an industry lobbying group formerly known as the British Sugar Bureau. Others on the team have previously been paid for research by the Dutch Sugar Bureau, UK sweetener brand Canderel, or are — as disclosed at the end of the study — “employees and shareholders of companies that manufacture products containing sugars and low-energy sweeteners.” \\n  \\n According to the Times on Sunday [reg. required], the researchers didn’t just get their funding for this study from ILSI Europe, the group also directly paid some of the academics involved around $1,090 each. \\n  \\n Which may not be a concern if the review hadn’t come to such a pro-industry conclusion — that the effect of diet drinks on body weight “appear neutral relative to water, or even beneficial in some contexts.” \\n  \\n As The Independent notes, of the 5,500 studies included in this review, it appears as if the researchers are only using the results of three to reach that conclusion. And of those three, only one — the 2014 paper, funded by the American Beverage Association, mentioned at the start of this story — actually showed any weight loss benefit compared to water. \\n  \\n The University of Bristol, where the study’s lead author teaches, stands by the research, pointing out that it has been peer-reviewed, “which means the data and conclusions have been scrutinised by other scientists.” The school also contends that the study received additional funding from the National Health Service and the European Union. \\n  \\n This news comes on the heels of Coca-Cola’s attempt to start a “political campaign” by providing more than $1 million to the University of Colorado Foundation “for the purposes of funding” a group called the Global Energy Balance Network, which stressed the importance of diet and exercise and downplayed the role of sugary foods in the obesity epidemic. \\n  \\n When Coke’s involvement in the GEBN became known, the beverage biggie claimed it took a hands-off approach to the group. However, subsequently revealed emails showed that Coca-Cola was heavily involved in shaping the group’s message, likening it to “a political campaign, we will develop, deploy and evolve a powerful and multi-faceted strategy to counter radical organizations and their proponents.” \\n  \\n On Nov. 30, weeks after the university gave back $1.1 million to Coca-Cola, GEBN disbanded, posting a notice to the website that Coca-Cola had registered on the group’s behalf. \\n  \\n Then came the news that Coca-Cola had paid $550,000 directly to the man who would eventually head GEBN, and even offered to help his son find a job. \\n  \\n Did you enjoy this?

              " \"By. Daily Mail Reporter. PUBLISHED:. 12:51 EST, 16 April 2013. |. UPDATED:. 12:57 EST, 16 April 2013. A judge declared a mistrial Tuesday after jurors said they couldn't reach a verdict in the case of a mental patient who slashed a New York City psychotherapist to death with a meat cleaver. The defense didn't dispute that David Tarloff, 45, killed Kathryn Faughey in February 2008, but Tarloff’s attorneys claimed that he was so psychotic that he couldn't tell what he was doing was wrong. The Manhattan District Attorney's office said Tarloff carried out a deliberate plan and understood it was illegal. Cause for mistrial: The defense claimed that David Tarloff (left) was so psychotic that he couldn't tell that killing Dr Kathryn Faughey (right) was wrong. A judge declared a mistrial after jurors said they couldn't agree on a verdict in Tarloff's case. ‘Mr. Tarloff knew it was wrong to shove a knife into someone,’ prosecutor Evan Krutoy said during summations. ‘He's mentally ill and he's guilty of murder.’ Tarloff faced a life in prison if convicted. The district attorney’s office plans to retry the case. Tarloff told authorities he set out to rob Faughey's officemate, encountered her instead and thought she was evil. Tarloff envisioned getting $40,000 from the holdup to whisk his sick mother away to Hawaii. Dangerous mind: Tarloff told authorities he set out to rob Faughey's officemate to get enough money to take his mother to Hawaii, but encountered her instead and thought she was evil. It was the jury's 10th day of deliberations, which appeared to be very heated judging by the shouting coming from the jury room, the New York Daily News reported. Just before 11.30am, the jury panel passed a note to the judge saying that they cannot reach an agreement on a verdict and will remain deadlocked on all counts. 'I'm willing to say that we're finished,' Manhattan Supreme Court Justice Edward McLaughlin said in response before declaring mistrial. ‘It's very disappointing for us, but we will be back until we get justice in this case for our sister,’ said Owen Faughey, one of the victim's brothers who looked shaken by the outcome. ‘We'll do whatever it takes, and we will see justice, I'm sure of that,’ said another, Michael Faughey.Faughey, 56, specialized in helping people with relationships. She'd never met Tarloff, let alone treated him. ‘We're terribly disappointed that the jury could not reach a unanimous decision,’ said defense attorney Frederick Sosinsky. ‘We believe this was a very powerful case for a `not responsible' verdict, as rare as those verdicts might be.’ Tarloff, now 45, was diagnosed with schizophrenia during his college years. He has been hospitalized more than a dozen times, recounted seeing ‘Satan’ spelled out in his mind and the ‘eye of God’ on the kitchen floor. Innocent victim: Tarloff slashed Faughey 15 times, fractured her skull with a rubber meat mallet, seriously wounded her officemate when he tried to rescue her, and fled. According to court papers, the defendant viewed pieces of paper on the street as a special message from God. His brother testified that he once came to find Tarloff naked and throwing eggs on the wall. For years, his relatives tried unsuccessfully to get him to stay in mental hospitals or adult homes, but he left them. After his mother moved from the Queens apartment they shared to a nursing home in 2004, Tarloff became convinced she was being mistreated and determined to get her out. He hit upon a scheme to get the money: Hold up Dr. Kent Shinbach, the psychiatrist who'd had first him hospitalized in 1991, to get the doctor's ATM code, he later told authorities. Chilling confession: A jury saw Tarloff in this 2008 police interrogation video saying that he only wanted money. After making a series of phone calls to find out the location and hours of Shinbach's office on Manhattan's Upper East Side, Tarloff bought a cutlery set, a rubber meat-pounding mallet and rope. He set out with those and a suitcase of adult diapers and clothes for his mother. Faughey, who shared Shinbach's office suite, confronted Tarloff. He slashed her 15 times, fractured her skull with the mallet, seriously wounded Shinbach when he tried to rescue her, and fled. Tarloff was not in court Tuesday and the jurors were not in court. Several jurors left declining to speak to reporters. Residence: NYPD officers outside his Queens apartment on February 16, 2008 after matching bloody fingerprints at the crime scene to his prints. Manhunt: Police arrested Tarloff in 2008 at his Queens apartment building. A few jurors stopped to talk to Faughey's three brothers and three sisters who were in court. The family could be overheard thanking them for their efforts. Lawyers will be back in court May 21 for status update.\",\n",

But I received an e-mail for a free small pizza for my birthday, so we decided to return to z-pizza for that. I ordered the Thai Pizza & was disappointed....  The peanut sauce lacked any yummy flavor, quite bland, & it was missing one of the toppings that it was supposed to have....no carrots. I complained up at the counter, & to compensate, they gave me a free drink. That was nice of them, but they should have told me up front, & not assume that I wouldn't realize that one of the toppings was missing, because I used to get the Thai Pizza all the time & I remember lots of carrots on it!  There was hardly any red onions or bean sprouts on it either!  However, there was a fair amount of chicken on it.  I will not be returning to z-pizza again.

              " '\\n– It\\'s never too late to say you\\'re sorry. An Italian town has apologized for sending the nation\\'s most famous poet into exile seven centuries ago, the Telegraph reports. A death warrant hanging over his head, Dante Alighieri fled the city of Florence in 1302, never to return again. The father of the Italian language was charged with fraud and extortion after becoming entangled in a feud between rival noble families. Living most of his remaining years in Verona, Dante\\'s persecution wasn\\'t all bad: It was during this time that he wrote his masterpiece, The Divine Comedy, which satirized his enemies and Florentine politics. He died in Ravenna in 1321. It was a magistrate named Cante Gabrielli who had signed the order sentencing Dante to burn at the stake, and now Gabrielli\\'s hometown wants to make up for that fact. Gubbio, in Umbria, is seeking pardon for its (admittedly distant) role in persecuting Dante because officials feel it is the town\\'s \"moral responsibility\" to do so, per a spokesperson. The town council voted 19 to five to revoke Dante\\'s exile, and also presented his descendants with its highest honor, the Golden Florin. \"We don’t intend this to be a reprisal against (Gabrielli), but rather highlight an event that changed the course of literary history,\" says Gubbio\\'s mayor. Last year, Italy celebrated the 750th anniversary of Dante\\'s birth, prompting other mea culpas—not all of them welcome. One of Dante\\'s descendants rejected Florence\\'s efforts to present him with that city\\'s Golden Florin, reports the Guardian; Count Pieralvise Serego Alighieri said the Florentines were not sorry enough. There was no word on whether he would accept Gubbio\\'s apology.',\n",

              " 'Not all problems have straightforward solutions; depression can be exacerbated by issues that are out of your control, like health problems, financial problems, and the death of a loved one. In order to overcome life’s toughest problems, it helps to get practice by tackling something you can change. What are the smaller obstacles in your life that cause you to feel negative day by day? Practice overcoming those, and you’ll gain strength to face the bigger issues.  Set solution-oriented goals. Think of concrete ways you can improve your situation. Has your house gotten overly cluttered? That’s something you can tackle. Make a detailed plan to clean the house, room by room, and allow yourself to feel satisfaction with each mission you accomplish. Keep track of your progress in a journal. Sometimes the simple act of writing a goal down provides motivation to move forward and make a change. Depression tends to cause people to retreat from life and avoid communicating a lot with other people, but it only gets worse when you keep emotions bottled up inside. Your feelings have value because they are a part of you, so find a way to express them.  Don’t spend too much time alone. Have daily conversations with friends, family and classmates and avoid negative people. It’s not necessary to talk about your depression; just be yourself and say what comes naturally. The most important thing is to remember you are not alone and there will be always someone ready to help.  Writing, dance, visual arts, music and other types of art can be extremely therapeutic forms of self expression. Don’t be afraid to express sadness, fear, anger, anxiety and the other emotions that accompany depression. These feelings are as much a part of life as happiness and satisfaction. Compounding your emotions with shame will only make you feel worse. Many people find that turning to spirituality helps them find peace when they’re dealing with depression.  Try  meditation, which is focused on developing thought patterns that lead to self-awareness and peace. Research meditation groups in your area or practice on your own. If you are a religious person, consider attending your place of worship more frequently, and getting involved in groups that meet outside of services. Spending time with like-minded people will give you the comfort of being part of a community. Depression can lead to extremely negative feelings about one’s abilities and personality. Focus on what you like about yourself and the positive things you have to offer the world, rather than dwelling on things that are going wrong. Don’t blame yourself for being depressed. Depression affects almost everyone at one point or another. You aren’t weak or cowardly; you have a condition that can be debilitating, and you’re taking steps to face it head-on. That’s brave.',\n",
              " 'I collect Horror films from all over and I have seen the good and the very bad - Zombie Bloodbath is a low budget video. Sure, the acting is bad, the storyline is basically a mix of all zombie movies thrown together and the quality is low in some spots. The thing you seem to be missing is that it\\'s still entertaining and really very fun. The effects range from, like someone on here has said, pasty-faced zombies that look like KISS rejects to really good ones with some amazing latex work. But the reason you buy a movie with a title like this is for the gore and this film is amazing in that area. The effects are very good for such a small film. Someone called it a Party movie and it is. 100% fun party movie. I have heard from various websites that this is actually a \"rough cut\" of the film that got general release but the actual \"director\\'s cut\" is coming on DVD and it is very nice quality. I will buy it and judge for myself.\\n\\nStory is basically a Nuclear power plant goes bad and makes zombies. The gov\\'t closes it down, hides the story and sanctions houses to be built over it. Some of the plant is still underground and these undead come up and attack the area. A few actors do a great job, there\\'s some pretty straight social commentary that is insightful and true, good music, great lighting, some effective suspense and tons of blood and sick gore. One guy gets attacked and ripped from the lower area all the way up, if you know what I mean. Then his guts are shoved out of his mouth. Another is torn in half like in Day Of The Dead and they did a great job of that effect. There are a million gore gags and it\\'s almost ALL action. I say stop being a prude, enjoy life and get more movies like Zombie Bloodbath and Meat market. Two great undead epics.\\n\\nOK - UPDATE!!! I just got the DVD set and here is what I thought:\\n\\nMUCH better picture quality and for once I was able to see the actual DIRECTOR\\'S CUT of the film and it is a much better movie. I liked it before, but now I can see what Todd Sheets was actually trying to do with this one. And the commentary helps too, hearing Sheets talk about the film in detail, He knows it\\'s a trashy zombie movie, but he does show respect to all people involved. Also, Sheets has a great sense of humor and some humble integrity that others could learn from in the movie field. The behind the scenes of Zombie Bloodbath is pretty fun as well. I felt it was almost as entertaining as the film it was made for. There are some great interviews and behind the scenes footage, mixed with news stories about the film from some major places like CNN, FOX and MTV. Over all, a fun little film that is VERY rough around the edges, but still had me laughing and enjoying the ride! I have seen many DV films, and some shot of video films, and many are quite dull, but this one really wasn\\'t. While newer DV films are technically superior, they just aren\\'t this much fun!\\n\\nPS - I heard they are now remaking this on a big budget???',\n",

              " 'By. Steve Nolan. PUBLISHED:. 10:49 EST, 10 January 2013. |. UPDATED:. 10:53 EST, 10 January 2013. Guilty: Majid Hussain is pictured arriving at Exeter Crown Court. Mr Hussain, who was found guilty of falsely claiming at least £35,000 in benefits, was handed a nine month suspended sentence. An Iraqi immigrant who falsely claimed at least £35,000 in benefits has been spared jail today. Majid Hussain claimed income support, housing benefit and a council tax reduction for more than a decade - despite having more than £35,000 stashed away in a bank account. He had denied three counts of benefit fraud but was found guilty at Exeter Crown Court. Hussain walked free from court however, when he was handed a nine month suspended sentence. The court had heard during the trial how Hussain, of Exeter in Devon, arrived in the UK as a mature student in the 1980s funded by Saddam Hussein\\'s government. He was left around £18,000 by his father but said that the money had been put into a Royal Bank of Scotland account for use as a trust fund to pay for his children\\'s education. But the unemployed 62-year-old signed forms saying that he did not have any undeclared savings when claiming benefits. He said that under Sharia law he did not consider the money to belong to him. While claiming benefits, the account grew to be worth £36,000. Hussain, who has never worked since he arrived in the UK, received at least £35,000 in benefits between 1997 and 2010 - though the precise figure can never be determined because records do not go back far enough. The father of four stopped receiving income support after the existence of the account was revealed in 2010 - at which point he immediately began withdrawing money from it. However, he is still receiving disability living allowance because he suffers from Crohn\\'s Disease, kidney problems and muscle pain. The jury was given a dossier of forms signed by the defendant in which he declared that neither he nor any of his children - aged between nine and 18 - had any savings affecting the means test for their benefits. His defence statement read: \\'He did not notify the DWP of some of the money under his control because it was left to him on strict Islamic terms by a relative for the sole use of his children. \\'In accordance with Islamic belief and law, there was no possibility or option for it ever to be used for his own use and as such there was no intention to deceive.\\' Sentenced: Majid Hussain claimed he did nothing wrong because he was acting under the rule of Islamic law. Testifying in court yesterday, Hussain said: \\'I read the Koran and in the Koran it commands you to honour your parents. \\'You have to respect them. In the Koran we call them the \"Second God\".\\' He continued: \\'I have an article of the Koran here - it says, \"Allah commands you to render back your trust to those to whom they are due and not to break your oath. For Allah knows all that you do.\" \\'That\\'s what we\\'ve been taught - always obey your parents. I was just going to keep the money for my children and not touch it. I had no right to the money.\\' He added that his father had \\'worked so hard\\' to save the money he gave his son, working in heat of up to 56C (133F). Hussain initially told investigators he had saved the money from the scholarship he received from the Iraqi government while studying at the University of Exeter from 1986 to 1996, according to prosecutor Gareth Evans. When an official asked him if he knew his benefits would be withdrawn if he had declared the account, he said \\'yes\\', the court heard. Home: The defendant has lived in the UK since moving from Iraq as a mature student in the 1980s. He then allegedly started withdrawing large sums of money from the RBS account, reducing it by £24,000 over seven months. Mr Evans told jurors: \\'I am afraid that his declarations that he had no bank accounts or savings with his wife or any children he was claiming for was a lie. \\'If he would have disclosed this account then he would not have been entitled to benefits at all. \\'He has been dishonest claiming his benefits, he knew that he should have declared the account and he failed to do so dishonestly in order to claim benefits.\\' Sentencing Hussain, Recorder Paul Dunkels QC said: \\'The jury rejected that this money was held in trust for your children\\'s education. \\'The (benefit) forms you filled in when making your claims made it perfectly clear that you had a duty to tell the authorities (of the money). \\'The real extent of how much money (paid in benefits) can never be obtained because your fraud has gone on for such a long period of time.\\' He made no order for costs, although confiscation proceedings are expected to be taken against Hussain.',\n",

The water is \"not a Jules Verne-style ocean you can sail a boat on,\" explains one of the authors of a study in the journal Nature, but is held inside minerals in the \"transition zone\" 250 to 400 miles underground. Researchers believe the water ended up deep underground as slabs of ocean crust sank into the mantle, reports LiveScience, though it could also be \"primordial\" water brought long ago by asteroids or comets. Evidence of the vast reservoir was provided by a water-rich sample of ringwoodite, a mineral that exists deep inside the mantle but has only ever before been seen in samples created in labs or extracted from meteorites. It was found in a battered diamond dug up by miners in Brazil. \"It\\'s a fairly ugly diamond. It looks like it\\'s been to hell and back,\" the lead researcher says, according to the Guardian.

Click on the photo to hear Cale at work. But Cale, 70, has never had a hit, and he\\'s primarily known as a musician\\'s musician. On a recent 2½-week tour, which wraps up April 15, he mainly played 700-seat clubs and theaters, and when it\\'s done, he\\'ll go back home to his house \"on a couple acres in the boonies\" north of San Diego, California, he says. He likes it that way. A new album \"is all mainly dictated by whoever\\'s doing my business end of it. I consider myself semi-retired. Every time I make an album, I go, \\'That\\'s the last one,\\' \" the native Oklahoman said in a voice as rich and peppery as barbecue sauce. \"That\\'s somebody else\\'s idea to make a record and go out and play. I generally don\\'t go out and tour much anymore -- never did, much. I don\\'t really hustle that. ... On a good day, I\\'m feeling good, I say I\\'ll make another record and go on tour, and on a bad day, I\\'ll say, \\'What have I committed myself to?\\' \" The house, he said, \"is quiet. And I\\'m a musician. That\\'s what I like about it.\" It\\'s a good place for the one-time audio engineer to tinker and compose, though he says he\\'s not conscious of creating the J.J. Cale sound. \"It\\'s all accident,\" he said. \"I never know what I\\'m doing. Writing songs, you start with a clean piece of paper, so you just start screwing with it. Most of the stuff you write, and sometimes even when you\\'re finished, you go, \\'That ain\\'t worth a damn,\\' but you don\\'t throw it away.\" On \"Roll On,\" the groove works in mysterious ways. \"Who Knew,\" the opening track, gains an ominous intensity: \"Who knew / Not me, not you or anyone else / Come to think of it, it\\'s true / We\\'re misinformed and always warned to look out / Who knew,\" he sings, a lonely sax moaning behind his voice. (Listen to \"Who Knew\" in the MP3 box under Cale\\'s photo.) But the groove gives a touch of wistfulness to \"Down to Memphis\" and even a little dance-funk to \"Fonda-Lina.\" Cale comes by the variety honestly: He remembers his formative years as soaking in a brew of country, jazz and early rock \\'n\\' roll. \"I\\'m so old, I can remember before rock \\'n\\' roll come along,\" he recalled. \"When I was a young fellow, I played guitar for other people, so I\\'d have to learn [cover tunes]. ... So the guitar players on all those early recordings, I guess, influenced what I did. I never could get it exactly right the way they played it, and I guess that helped the style that evolved.\" In 1964, Cale and his friend Leon Russell -- along with bassist Carl Radle, later of Derek and the Dominos -- decided to try their luck in Los Angeles. Russell quickly became an in-demand session man, but Cale didn\\'t meet with the same success and soon returned to Oklahoma. But he kept writing and recording, and after Russell signed him to his label, Shelter, \"After Midnight\" found its way to Clapton. The song hit the Top 20 in 1970, and Cale was suddenly in demand. He\\'s put out albums every two or three years since then, but he\\'s just as happy to have others cover his material, particularly Clapton. \"[His] recording all those songs has really helped me pay my rent, \\'cause he sells a lot of records,\" he chuckled. After more than 50 years making music, he still seems a little surprised by success, even at his under-the-radar level. \"I was mainly entertaining myself and still am,\" he said. \"Making music is fun if you forget about you\\'re doing it as a commercial thing. And I never did think that. A couple things became commercial, and that came as a surprise.\" Which has allowed him to keep playing and keep tinkering. And to keep being J.J. Cale, creating that groove. \"When I approach [a new recording], I always think I\\'m going to sound different than J.J. Cale, to surprise people,\" he said. \"And when I get through, it just sounds like me, and there\\'s nothing I can do about it.\"',\n",

              " \"By. Anna Edwards. A widow has spoken for the first time about the horrific death of her husband who was eaten by his friends after the party got lost at sea in bitter temperatures for nearly two months. Olga Kurochkin, 37, said her life had been ruined by the terrible fate of Andrei whose remains were found in the pitiless eastern reaches of Siberia. Two members of the four-strong party survived the ordeal and, after carrying the head of 44-year-old Mr Kurochkin through the wild, told police they had eaten the man from Saratov after he froze to death. Forensic analysis of Mr Kurochkin's body parts revealed that sections of flesh had been carefully sliced away while joints had been butchered. Andrei's heartbroken wife Olga (pictured on their wedding day) said: 'I never expected such horror could come into my life' after she learned what had happened to her spouse. Olga (pictured with daughter Alyona and husband Andrei) says that her life has been totally ruined and that she only has a few remains of her partner. Speaking to The Siberian Times Mrs Kurochkin said: 'I never expected such horror could come into my life. It has ruined. not just my life, but also the lives of all our relatives, and we are a. big family. 'Can you imagine what I have left? One foot with toes, one finger, and the back of his skull with some hair. 'This is it. This is all I have left. from the man I loved. Having just these remains, how can I say goodbye. to him? I have got almost nothing to cry over. 'I can't think about it, I am losing my mind with this.' Mrs Kurochki, who has a daughter Alyona, 21, is suing survivors Alexander Abdullaev, 37, and Alexei. Gorulenko, 35, for emotional distress. She also wants a criminal prosecution brought against them. 'I don't want to suspect them of murder, this would be just. too much,' she added. 'But I do want them to be punished for what they did, because it is just outrageous to leave it like this. 'Now I want these cannibals to be punished. I fear our police is not keen to investigate this case properly. 'Our law does not say a word about. cannibalism, it is not a crime, so our two survivors can be punished. only for defiling a body and perhaps leaving a human being in danger. 'The. (police) report did not leave me any hope, now I can be sure my husband. Andrei is dead and his body was found there in the taiga. 'I am sure they have eaten him. Now we know that Andrei died somewhere else and they dragged the body. all the way through the snow, eating it step by step. 'But together with the remains of my husband there were also found the bones of animals. 'If they could kill animals, why would they need to try eating a human body? And why did they carry his head with them?' Mr Kurochkin set out with his friends from Dipkun village, Amur region, on an epic fishing trip-of-a-lifetime to eastern Siberia on August 8 last year. Survivors Alexei Gorulenko (pictured) and  Alexander Abdullaev are being sued for emotional distress by Olga Kurochkin after they admitted to eating him. Olga and her daughter will have to live with the gruesome fact of how Andrei died. Catastrophe struck early in to their. trip when their jeep sunk in a frozen river leaving the party stranded. in one of the most isolated spots in the world. All. four took refuge in a remote hunting lodge, which they used as a base. for a number of weeks, until they exhausted its food supplies. They. did not seem in any rush to escape from the taiga, despite losing their. fishing tackle and the vehicle, in which they had often slept. During. this period they encountered a number of hunters who had vehicles and. walkie-talkies. At least one let them use his satellite phone. As conditions worsened they began walking back to civilisation at the beginning of October. They left a note in a hunter's house saying they had sheltered under the owner's roof and eaten all his food. They also left 3,000 roubles – around £60. Their progress back to civilisation was haphazard. Had. they been fit and properly equipped, they could have covered the. distance in a matter of days, even with the snow and sub-zero. temperatures. But it took almost seven weeks before two of them were found some nine miles from Dipkun. In. this time it is known all four took refuge in another empty hunter’s. shack near the Daurka River, an area described by locals as lonely and. macabre. In recent years, seven dead bodies have been found there. They were found in the Sakha Republic by a Russian Emergencies Ministry rescue helicopter which saved their lives. Abdullaev eventually confessed to the authorities that they had eaten Mr Kurochkin. 'He died by himself. He froze to. death. Only after that did we start eating him,' Abdullaev told. Neryungri police in the Sakha Republic. 'At one point they were surviving on moss and sawdust. A lie detector test proves they were desperate,' said one official. While he is now assisting investigators, Gorulenko escaped first. to Chita, then Moscow, and then vanished altogether ten days ago, say. reports. The other fisherman in the group Viktor Komarov, 47, has still not been found. Survivors Alexander Abdullaev and Alexander Abdullaev (pictured being rescued) had been missing for nearly two months after their jeep sunk in a frozen river stranding the ice-fishing party in one of the most isolated spots in the world. Alexei Gorulenko, pictured, was kept alive for a week by eating his friend's body before they were rescued.\",\n",

A motorist has been arrested by police investigating the death of a 16-year-old boy who fell from a bridge onto a motorway. The driver was detained after college student Aaron Cook fell about 30 feet into the path of oncoming traffic on the M6 motorway on Saturday morning. Four vehicles swerved to avoid the teenager, but a fifth vehicle ran him over as he lay on the carriageway. The driver then sped away without stopping or reporting the accident. Today Lancashire Police said a 38-year-old man had been arrested on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving following the death near junction 28 of the motorway at Leyland. The suspect, from Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, was also being questioned on suspicion of failing to notify police of an accident. Police are appealing for witnesses who may have seen the tragedy to come forward. The southbound carriageway was closed for six hours between junctions 27 and 28 for a scene investigation to be carried out. Sgt Dave Hogarth from the Force Road Policing Unit said: 'This is a tragic incident in which a young man has lost his life and we are doing all we can to identify his next of kin and establish the circumstances of exactly what happened. 'The vehicle that collided with man is described as a dark coloured saloon and I would appeal to anybody that witnessed this collision to contact us.' In a statement,. the dead boy’s family said: 'Aaron Cook was 16 years old, studying. Childcare at Runshaw College. 'He wanted to be a Nursery Teacher. He. loved spending time with his friends and family and will be deeply. missed. Today one girl said Aaron - described. as a 'guardian angel with a heart of pure gold' - had helped protect her. from the tormentors. In a message on a Facebook tribute page the girl said: 'Have a nice day up there, carry on being an angel. 'Thanks. for everything you did for me when I was being bullied, wish I could of. given you something back for it so so sad that you’re gone.' Four drivers swerved to avoid the boy as he lay on the carriageway, but a fifth hit him and drove off, police say. The teen's family paid tribute to Aaron, saying he loved spending time with friends and will be sorely missed. Another. person then responded: 'He was very kind to you and you have fun. memories of going round the fair with him and all he did for you when. you were being bullied - was so kind of him. 'He. knew you appreciated it and that’s why he helped you out. God bless you. aaron for looking after her through that tough year...you are a true. angel.' In a posting Paige Hyland said: 'RIP Aaron we may not have seen each other much&speak much but the times we did have together all the laughs and messing around I will cherish of the rest of my life. 'U will be well and truly missed by so many people. It’s such shocking and saddening news. You will always be in our hearts. We will miss that beautiful smile of yours.' Floral tributes to the teen, who wanted to become a primary school teacher, pictured at the scene near junction 28 of the motorway. Kimberley Bateman said: 'Sleep tight Aaron. Every1s only wish is that you could have held out and not let them drive you away from this world. 'Just know that 1 day there will be justice for you and many like you. We will beat the bullies for you. You will be missed and loved till eternity.' James Aspinall said: 'I also remember when you helped me get out a fight and brought me home safe and sound.

              " '– Flint residents still worried about their water get an added dose of aggravation starting this month: They have to pay their bills in full. The state has been covering about two-thirds of the cost for about a year now, in the wake of revelations that the tap water was unsafe to drink, reports NPR. No more. Now that state officials have deemed the water safe again, the subsidies disappeared as of March 1. While that designation might sound like good news, plenty of skepticism abounds, and not just from local residents. The water is still \"unsafe to drink,\" pediatrician Mona Hanna-Attisha, who first helped bring the problem to the nation\\'s attention, tells ABC News. Not helping ease fears is the state\\'s recommendation that people continue to filter the water before drinking it. What\\'s more, pipe replacement isn\\'t finished. \"For years, Flint residents paid the highest water rates in the country for water that was and continues to be unsafe to drink,” says Hanna-Attisha. “The people of Flint should not pay for water today nor for years to come.” The counterpoint comes from a scientist who helped conduct the new tests for the state. Flint\\'s water is \"in the range of other cities with old pipe,\" he says, while acknowledging that a \"horrible infrastructure crisis\" remains to be fixed. A report at WJRT suggests that Flint water bills are indeed among the highest in the nation, though the city couldn\\'t provide an average. Anecdotally, the station reported that monthly bills range from $60 into the hundreds. (There\\'s going to be a TV movie with Cher about the mess.)',\n",
              " 'President Obama\\'s decision to grant some benefits to the same-sex partners of federal employees is seen by some as his attempt to extend an olive branch to the gay and lesbian community, but critics say it\\'s \"too little, too late.\" Some critics say President Obama has let the gay community down. \"It seems to me at least to be a nice gesture, but a disappointment,\" said Richard Kim, a senior editor at The Nation magazine. The memorandum Obama signed Wednesday is not expected to grant health and retirement benefits to same-sex partners, as that is prohibited under the Defense of Marriage Act. \"It will absolutely be seen as something good -- but I think, for example, it not including full health insurance -- that is going to put a real microscope on that question. You know, why not?\" Kim said, adding that the memo applies only to federal employees, so most people will not be affected by it. Charles Moran, the spokesman for the Log Cabin Republicans, said the lack of full benefits in Thursday\\'s memorandum shows a lack of commitment to the gay community. \"That\\'s the part that just shows that the Obama administration really isn\\'t serious about their promises to the gay and lesbian community. Things like the health benefits, things like retirement benefits and coverage for spouses. These are the core issues,\" Moran said. \"Why start the marathon if you\\'re not serious about ending the race?\" he added. White House officials involved in discussions with gay-rights advocates say that Obama favors extending full health care benefits to same-sex couples but that will take legislation to accomplish. Moran said Obama has had multiple opportunities to fulfill his promises to the gay and lesbian community -- including by repealing the military\\'s \"don\\'t ask, don\\'t tell\" policy and standing against the Justice Department motion filed last week in support of the Defense of Marriage Act. \"Here we are, several months after he\\'s been inaugurated, and we\\'ve gotten basically nothing. So it is too little, too late,\" Moran said. White House Spokesman Robert Gibbs said Obama will keep his word. \"[Extending benefits to same-sex couples] is a matter of fairness. The president is committed to ensuring that fairness as well as working on and fulfilling other promises that he has made in the campaign around things like \\'don\\'t ask, don\\'t tell,\\' \" Gibbs said. The president has faced sharp criticism over the Justice Department\\'s filing in support of the Defense of Marriage Act, which opposes same-sex marriage. The act used the government\\'s interest in opposing incestuous marriages to support its position against same-sex marriage. Openly gay Rep. Barney Frank said the Obama administration made a \"big mistake\" and is calling on the president to clearly explain his views on the matter. \"The wording they used was inappropriate,\" the Massachusetts Democrat told the Boston Herald in an interview published in the paper\\'s Wednesday edition. Many gay activists have called on Frank and other gay members of Congress to speak out against the recent Department of Justice brief. The rancor threatens to disrupt a big Democratic National Committee gay fundraiser in Washington next week. Vice President Biden is the guest at next Thursday\\'s DNC\\'s LBGT Leadership Council 10th Annual Dinner in Washington. Critics are calling for Frank and other gay congressional leaders to boycott the dinner, for which tickets go for $1,000 to $30,000 a plate. Activist David Mixner and blogger Andy Towle, two well-known gay rights advocates, announced that they were pulling out, citing disappointment with the Defense of Marriage Act brief. iReport.com: Share your thoughts on Obama and same-sex marriage. The president also rankled gay advocates before his inauguration when he named megachurch pastor the Rev. Rick Warren to deliver the invocation at his swearing-in. Warren, in an interview with Belief.net, likened homosexuality to bestiality and incest. He also supported California\\'s Proposition 8, which banned same-sex marriage in that state. During the Warren controversy, Obama -- who frequently spoke in favor of gay and lesbian rights during the campaign but has said he opposes same-sex marriage -- declared himself \"a fierce advocate for gay and lesbian Americans.\" Given the support Obama received from the gay community during the campaign season, Kim said so far, the Obama administration has let gay and lesbian rights activists down. Obama got 70 percent of the vote from those who identified themselves as gay, lesbian or bisexual, according to CNN exit polls. \"I think there is an overwhelming feeling that he has not lived up to expectations on these matters,\" he said. But, he added, \"there\\'s some sympathy for him -- there\\'s the worst recession since the Great Depression, troops are in two different countries in the Middle East -- so there\\'s a lot on his plate.\" Kim said Obama\\'s full agenda, however, shouldn\\'t be used as an excuse to delay action on gay rights issues. If the administration waits until there is a news hole, then the issues will be subject to a lot of debate, he said. \"In the middle of the health care debate, saying we\\'re going to do health care, we\\'re going to fix the economy and then this other [gay rights] stuff -- of course it\\'s right. It doesn\\'t require a national debate,\" he said. \"This is stuff that\\'s been debated forever. America does not need a huge national debate on some of these issues,\" Kim said. Kim said while Obama has disappointed the gay community, he still has some time to make good on his campaign promises. \"I think people will wait through the first two legislative sessions, but then after that some of this stuff does need to move to the front,\" he said.',\n",

The Guinness helped for the most part, though I was not pleased with the level of service we received throughout the meal. Our waitress simply was not personable and provided only minimal service. I am confused because of all of the positive reviews posted here on the personable service. Perhaps it was a bad night for our waitress. Anyway I only tipped 10% that night.

              " '– On March 2, 2002, Mike McQueary went to Joe Paterno to tell him what he’d seen the night before in the Penn State locker room: Former defensive coordinator Jerry Sandusky raping a boy who looked to be about 10. McQueary, then a 28-year-old grad assistant in the football program, immediately fled the locker room after witnessing the scene. Sources tell the New York Times that the next day McQueary gave Paterno, the athletic director, and another senior administrator all the details of what he saw. McQueary was told, weeks later, that Sandusky was no longer allowed to bring children on campus, and there’s no evidence showing that he pushed the issue further after that point. The Times paints a picture of McQueary as a local kid who lived and breathed football and led Penn State’s Nittany Lions as a senior quarterback—and one of just two Penn State employees known to have witnessed Sandusky’s alleged sexual abuse. Neighbors, teammates, and a former coach describe him as “a real decent” kid, a “fiery” redhead who was constantly tossing a football. After returning to Penn State to work in the football program in 1999, it became McQueary’s dream to someday take over Paterno’s job as head coach; after the 2002 incident, he continued rising up the ranks, often visible at Paterno’s side. The Times notes that Saturday’s Penn State game could determine whether the Lions will reach a major bowl game—and TMZ reports that McQueary will still be acting as receivers coach that day.',\n",

              " 'Insight in essence is both knowledge and understanding derived from an \"inward sight\", or more simply, looking inside your own mind and body and observing it. It can be a natural process, or an intentional process as sometimes you need to see things differently to see them clearly, but most important is knowing which lens or style to use to make it clear.  When seeing and studying something, you might gain an understanding on how and why it happens simply by seeing it as it happens and not passing judgement. The more you watch, and the greater your depth of observation, the more information you can pick up. Knowledge is the understanding that is gained and is the part that you can use.  In its simplest example, you might learn that fire is hot, but only through touching its heat. Likewise if you don\\'t remember that it\\'s harmful and use that knowledge next time you reach to pick up something hot, you will burn yourself. The skill is all about developing insight so it becomes more than basic survival skills, but a way to improve skills and our quality of life and learn things on a much deeper level of understanding. General mindfulness and meditation is a classic format when observing the mind and body but also for any subject you wish such as when gazing at a beautiful garden, complex poetry or art or when studying a recipe book, instruction manual or textbook. Its best to be aware that meditation (or any means used to gain an inward perspective) typically consists of two things:  1. The initiation of a laboratory-like or study field literally the moment you pay attention to it. Generally, everyone has practiced observation and had insights of various degrees throughout their life, but it generally is on a superficial level until the person decides to get to the bottom of the matter, or when they have observed so much of the subject it is more apparent. 2. When practiced to the degree of deep focus or absorption, meditation allows the mind to become far more clear, calmed and focused and can look at things without distortions or personal agendas. Seeing a sample under a microscope is a lot more detailed and focused than just looking at the sample in the hand. Developing the mind through meditation as well as other methodologies both sharpen your focus and gives you a clearer boundary on the thing you focus on.  However, it would be inaccurate to conclude that very deep meditation is the only way to the goal itself although it certainly does help. You might see the finer detail through a microscope certainly, but an example to consider is how expert geologists can tell the quality and type of soil in their hand just through the naked eye, or by using specific gravity tests and other chemical analyses. These skills are learned through experience and testing their understanding. They might have used a microscope in their training and career, or they might never have done so. In this instance, it is like a bird with two wings, observation - such as meditation - is one wing, examining and understanding is the other wing. If the bird has only one wing it can\\'t fly well, it will just go round in circles. They typically arise more in an intentional, guided or an intensive style of study practice rather than those rare but life changing insights that simply happen. If you are familiar with them, you can at least recognize them when they happen and if they do pop up, arguably you can learn even more if you turn your attention to these very obstacles.  There is occasionally the idea that \"the means to the end\" is actually the \"end\" itself. The complication here is the process or relationship to the process has become more important than focusing on the subject. This can be quite a common experience many go through and some do end up going to universities and colleges all their life or studying the mind in meditation in a routine style, but never really making any breakthroughs. Try not to rush things. This is another common challenge as people hope to find a magic switch to get full understanding on their subject be it science, psychology, arts & literature and so on, or a cure for their troubles. As the metaphor goes, when the \"penny drops\" in the mind and things make sense, this often takes time to happen naturally. However, repeated observation and testing not only helps the penny drop sooner, but also the extent of the insight is broadened and many different facets can of the same experience can become clear. In this way, a person can learn to think and act more creatively and skilfully. Some also end up stuck with nowhere to go when the insight or knowledge gained is presumed as the goal itself. Insight is just one half of the story, the other half is doing something with it. Consider that a surgeon through his or her experience designs a new scalpel or forceps, but it\\'s only until these tools are used in surgery that they are going to be useful. In the same way, care must be taken to continuously apply and test any insights gained as well as how to use them as practical tools, which in itself can expand the depth of understanding. The application of understanding relationships is most important, and it goes awry when people prefer to focus on the intellectual, rather than the practical. For example a chemist might discover a new medicine through testing samples, but if the treatment is never made available or ever taken by the patient, it does nothing. The medicinal discovery itself does not destroy the disease. In the same way, you have to apply your understanding to achieve the goal, for the discoveries are just a means to an end.',\n",

              " 'Just 90 miles away, Cuba inevitably shares a long history with the United States, from conquistadors to the Spanish-American War to the Cold War. Here are some of the top moments in that history, even before the countries came into being. Old World meets New World. Christopher Columbus lands on Cuba in 1492 and claims the island for Spain, leading the way for that country\\'s conquistadors to explore the Caribbean and the part of the U.S. Southeast that\\'s now Florida, among other parts of the Americas. Spanish-American War. The United States helps Cuba win independence from Spain in a war between the European country and the Americans in 1898. In one of the more famous moments, Theodore Roosevelt and his Rough Riders charge up Cuba\\'s Kettle Hill during the Battle of Santiago, and the so-called 1st Volunteer Cavalry become instant heroes. The United States is given temporary control of Cuba under the Treaty of Paris, and Roosevelt later becomes U.S. President. Guantanamo Bay. The U.S. occupation of Cuba lasts until 1902, during which U.S. forces modernize the capital\\'s infrastructure. By 1903, the new Republic of Cuba allows for the creation of a U.S. naval base in Guantanamo Bay in 1903, whose military moniker becomes \"Gitmo.\" Cuban Revolution. In 1959, Fidel Castro, his brother Raul and their band of bearded guerrillas stage a successful communist revolution overthrowing President Fulgencio Batista, a U.S. ally. Fidel Castro goes on to become one of the world\\'s longest-ruling leaders, for more than 50 years, and one of the most vocal critics of capitalism and U.S. policies. U.S. embargo. After the Cuban Revolution leads to the nationalization of about $1 billion of U.S.-owned property on the island, the U.S. government imposes a trade embargo on Cuba in 1960 that\\'s designed to destabilize the communist regime. The Castros refer to this sanction as a \"blockade\" that they claim causes many of Cuba\\'s problems. Bay of Pigs and missile crisis. The United States and Cuba come to the brink of nuclear war following a series of events that begins when U.S.-backed Cuban exiles invade the island at the Bay of Pigs. But the exiles suffer a crushing defeat in 1961, embarrassing the U.S. government. The following year, Cuba allows the Soviet Union to build missile installations on the isle, a major crisis in the Cold War. The standoff ends when the Soviet Union withdraws the missiles and the Americans promise not to invade Cuba.  Secretly, Washington also agrees to remove U.S. ballistic missiles deployed in Turkey against the Soviets. Mariel exodus. Flotillas of rafts and boats carry a mass movement of refugees from Cuba to Florida in 1980. In all, about 124,000 Cuban migrants take to the water and enter the United States. Fidel Castro enabled the exodus by allowing his people to leave Cuba freely from the port of Mariel. Elian Gonzalez. Only 5, Elian Gonzalez is the only boat survivor of a group of refugees fleeing Cuba to Florida in 1999. An international incident erupts during a custody battle between the boy\\'s father in Cuba and his relatives in the United States. At gunpoint, U.S. agents remove the boy from his great-uncle\\'s home, and Elian is returned to Cuba in 2000. Gitmo Part II. After the September 11, 2001, attacks on the United States, President George W. Bush uses the Guantanamo Bay Naval Base as a detention facility for terror suspects. At its height, the facility hold more than 750 detainees and becomes a flashpoint of controversy about its legality as a prison and about alleged mistreatment of detainees. Under an agreement, the U.S. government sends Cuba about $4,085 a year to lease the land. Fidel Castro, however, is said to have called the U.S. base in Guantanamo \"a dagger plunged into the Cuban soil,\" and the last time Cuba took the U.S. payments was in 1959, when the Castros took power.',\n",

              " 'From color-popping dresses to bold prints and shapes, Afro-centric designs have been storming catwalks in recent years, catching the eye of fashionistas across the world. But for many international consumers, especially those with no access to shops dedicated to African brands, it can often be hard to get their hands on designer garments from the continent. As a result, more and more African designers are taking their lines to the web in a bid to reach out to a larger market. And while many are setting up their own websites, others rely on internet boutiques which have more experience navigating the online market. One such store is My Asho -- launched in June 2009, this UK-based web boutique carries the work of established and up-and-coming African designers, giving them a chance to showcase their creations to a wider audience. Founder Dolapo Shobanjo says she started My Asho -- taken from the Yoruba word \"aso\" which means cloth -- when she realized that African designers were not getting the promotion they deserved. \"I contacted the top designers, I spoke to them and asked them about their struggle and how difficult it is for them,\" says Shobanjo. \"That\\'s really how it got started, so to create that credible infrastructure is to show the global demand for the products and that will kick start the productions.\" Today, My Asho stocks a variety of womenswear, children\\'s clothes and accessories from more than 30 African designers. Shobanjo says she is very careful when it comes to selecting new designers, making sure they have high professional standards. \"We\\'re very happy to add new people in the site but we have to ensure that the designers we add are serious,\" she says. \"There are a lot of people out there who claim to be African designers but it\\'s more like \\'oh, I have a tailor who can sew very well and who can copy items,\\' so we have to distinguish between copy-cats and people doing this as a hobby.\" One of the designers featured on the site is Erzumah Ackerson who runs clothing label Bestow Elan. She says My Asho is an ideal platform for her work, helping her to make her creations more visible as well as boost demand. \"I think there\\'s still an element of investment that still needs to be done so we are recognized on an international as well as mainstream platform but I think My Asho is a perfect platform because since I\\'ve been on there, I\\'ve had a lot of international buyers and got into mainstream magazines.\" And as this digital expansion is helping create more demand, many African designers are now having to keep up in their supply. Titi Ademola, a Ghana-based designer who is the founder of the KIKI Clothing brand, says the biggest challenge for many fashion designers is manufacturing. \"You get a lot of excitement from so many places but once you get an order, how do you manufacture in large quantities?\" says Ademola. \"So, that\\'s the issue that I\\'m facing, trying to focus on quality control and trying to ensure that you consistently provide quality and appealing garments to other companies and other markets,\" she adds. With clients in more than 50 countries, Shobanjo\\'s goal is to create a sustainable business model for My Asho. At the same time, she also wants her company to help her continent by supporting local African communities where the clothes are manufactured. As a result, Shobanjo\\'s prioritized working with ethical brands that show a commitment to fair labor practices and create opportunities for their communities. \"I\\'m supporting Africa, helping it grow and creating jobs but it\\'s not to say that a certain percentage of x is going to here because I don\\'t think that is a sustainable business model,\" says Shobanjo. \"I think it is better to create from the start ethical principles and work with designers who pay their tailors well, who are investing in helping their communities grow and then once you grow as a business then you know that they will also grow as well.\" Teo Kermeliotis contributed to this article.',\n",

The New York Times points out the question has been answered before, and those previous estimates have been higher: This 2011 study found the average to be 0.66 grams per joint (while noting blunts used even more, at 0.97 grams).

Two interesting sidenotes from the Times: First, the estimate isn\\'t perfect—a point that researchers Greg Ridgeway and Beau Kilmer concede—because the data was sourced from a single group, those who have been arrested.

I email the menu to her, we both discuss the $65 four course, excitement builds.  We arrive at the place, which is an underwhelming square on the outside. We walk in and am struck by how plain things were - the plain white walls felt like the small retail store that the building was obviously intendedly sized for. An uninspired light in the middle of the building was the only attempt to change it. We stand at the front of the dining room before the waitstaff emerged from the back wall and walked the length of the room to take our names.  We are seated, and when the waitress hands us the menus, she informs my girlfriend that if she wants to have her dietary restrictions observed as had been emailed, she needed to get the tasting menu. She did use her tone to try to imply that this might be optional maybe, but her words were that the chef specifically prepared a tasting menu selection just for her. A $48 dollar up-sell using the implied threat of a deathly allergic reaction.   She then tried to take our orders right there, on the spot.   I had to interject into this and say that we needed a minute. She walked away, and my girlfriend immediately said how that exchange made her feel uncomfortable. I, not wanting to pay $200+ for a dinner at anywhere that thinks that sort of tactic is acceptable, agreed. The tone of the entire dinner was going to be negative.

              " '– President Obama thinks solitary confinement does far more harm than good when it comes to juvenile offenders, and he\\'s now banning the punishment outright in federal prisons. The president laid out his reasoning in a Washington Post op-ed, declaring that \"the United States is a nation of second chances, but the experience of solitary confinement too often undercuts that second chance.\" Instead of rehabilitation, it\\'s more likely to result in long-term psychological damage, he said. Obama also ordered federal prisons to restrict the use of solitary confinement with adult prisoners and to expand treatment of inmates with mental illness. USA Today notes that the juvenile ban won\\'t affect many kids: It covers only federal facilities, which house few juveniles. As of December, 71 juveniles were in Bureau of Prisons sites, and only 13 of them had spent any time at all in solitary in the previous year. Still, Obama writes that he hopes the federal action will \"serve as a model\" for state and local facilities, where the vast majority of juvenile offenders are held. “How can we subject prisoners to unnecessary solitary confinement, knowing its effects, and then expect them to return to our communities as whole people?” he writes. “It doesn’t make us safer. It’s an affront to our common humanity.” In a statement, Amnesty International called the reforms \"a momentous break with this shameful legacy, and an acknowledgement that tens of thousands of human beings should not be condemned to live in a cage.\" In a separate story, the Washington Post notes that at least 12 states have taken steps in the last year or two to curb solitary confinement, sometimes as the result of lawsuits.',\n",

              " '\\nFormer Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty will propose significant reductions in the corporate and individual tax rates Tuesday while calling for deep spending cuts that could see the federal government abandon its role delivering the mail or backstopping home loans. \\n  \\n Reuters Tim Pawlenty, speaking at a Tax rally in Concord, New Hampshire, earlier this year. The former Minnesota governor will call for deep cuts in taxes and spending in a speech Tuesday. \\n  \\n The proposals are part of an economic plan Mr. Pawlenty will unveil later today in remarks at the University of Chicago. The plan, according to excerpts provided by Mr. Pawlenty’s campaign, is tailored to the business community and fiscal conservatives as he seeks the Republican presidential nomination, but its impact on the deficit is unclear, given the potential drop in tax revenue. \\n  \\n Mr. Pawlenty wants to reduce the corporate tax rate from 35% to 15% and create just two tax brackets for individuals and families: a 10% rate on the first $50,000 of income for individuals – or $100,000 for married couples – and a 25% rate for all other income. In addition, he will call for the elimination of taxes on capital gains, dividends, interest income and inheritance. \\n  \\n One challenge for Mr. Pawlenty is to show that his plan would not explode a deficit that is expected to top $1.6 trillion, given that cutting rates so steeply could prompt a fall-off in tax revenues. The plan could expose Mr. Pawlenty to criticism from Democrats or even rivals for the Republican presidential nomination who have all made deficit-reduction a hallmark of the primary fight. \\n  \\n Indeed, Democrats quickly made just that claim. “No one should be surprised that a failed former governor who left his state with a massive projected budget deficit in the billions of dollars is now proposing to massively explode the deficit at the federal level,” said Brad Woodhouse, a spokesman for the Democratic National Committee. \\n  \\n In order to offset any lost tax revenue — and to tackle the deficit — Mr. Pawlenty calls for something called “The Google Test” to determine whether the government should be involved in a program. \\n  \\n “If you can find a good or service on the Internet, then the federal government probably doesn’t need to be doing it,” Mr. Pawlenty says. “The post office, the government printing office, Amtrak, Fannie [Mae] and Freddie [Mac], were all built in a time in our country when the private sector did not adequately provide those products. That’s no longer the case.” \\n  \\n He calls on Congress to freeze spending at current levels and impound 5% of spending until the budget is balanced. “If they won’t do it … I will,” he plans to say. \\n  \\n The former governor will call for terminating all federal regulations, unless Congress votes to keep them individually. \\n  \\n The excerpts don’t address any reforms to federal entitlement programs, such as Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security – a major sticking point in federal negotiations over paring the deficit. \\n  \\n The proposals included in this platform would put Mr. Pawlenty on a collision course with President Barack Obama and congressional Democrats over the vision for government, if Republican primary voters give him that opportunity. \\n  \\n “Regrettably, President Obama is a champion practitioner of class warfare,” Mr. Pawlenty will say. “Elected with a call for unity and hope, he has spent three years dividing our nation, fanning the flames of class envy and resentment to deflect attention from his own failures and the economic hardship they have visited on America.” \\n  \\n ______________________________________________________ \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n Politics Alerts: Get email alerts on breaking news and big scoops.

A new Washington Post-ABC News poll shows that nearly six in 10 Americans believe the economy hasn\\'t yet recovered from the recession. \\n  \\n In a theoretical match-up between Pawlenty and Mr. Obama in the poll, Pawlenty wins 41 percent in the Post poll to Mr. Obama\\'s 50 percent. \\n  \\n \"How did you enjoy your economic recovery last summer? Well, that\\'s what President Barack Obama said we were having,\" Pawlenty said today. He gave the same commentary in a Chicago Tribune op-ed. \"He wrongly thought the stimulus, the bailouts and the takeovers were the solution. He said they worked.\" \\n  \\n Pawlenty\\'s plan for economic recovery stands largely on modifying the tax code. He proposes cutting tax loopholes and instituting a three-tiered individual income tax. Those who currently pay no income tax would continue to pay nothing. After that, he suggests the first $50,000 of income - or $100,000 for married couples - would be taxed at 10 percent. Everything above that would be taxed at 25 percent. Pawlenty says he would also eliminate the capital gains tax, interest income tax, dividends tax and the estate tax. \\n  \\n Cutting the individual tax rate would spur job growth, Pawlenty argues, since small and medium-sized businesses are often taxed under individual rates. \\n  \\n Former Minnesota Governor and Republican presidential hopeful Tim Pawlenty takes questions from students following a address at the University of Chicago on June 7, 2011 in Chicago, Illinois. Pawlenty discussed his views about the nation\\'s economy to approximately 100 students gathered in the lecture hall on the campus. (Credit: Scott Olson/Getty Images) \\n  \\n After he delivered remarks, one member of the audience questioned Pawlenty\\'s allegation that Mr. Obama has been stoking \"class warfare.\" Given that two rounds of tax cuts over the past decade have favored the wealthy, and Pawlenty is suggesting more, the audience member asked Pawlenty who was winning that \"class war.\" \\n  \\n In spite of his charges against the president, Pawlenty said he would like to \"try to transcend the class warfare rhetoric and get back to reality.\" \\n  \\n For most Americans, he said, the only true quest is \"whether they have a job or not.\" \\n  \\n Pawlenty used the opportunity to bring up his personal background and point out that he comes from a background \"that is not of wealth,\" giving him a \"different perspective\" than others. \\n  \\n In addition to modifying income taxes, Pawlenty suggests slashing the business tax rate from 35 percent to 15 percent. \"American businesses today pay the second highest tax rates in the world,\" Pawlenty said. \"That\\'s a recipe for failure, not adding jobs and economic growth. \\n  \\n Calling regulations a \"hidden tax,\" Pawlenty suggests requiring the sunsetting of all federal regulations, unless specifically sustained by a vote of Congress. He also calls for capping and block-granting Medicaid to the states, raising the Social Security retirement age for the next generation, and passing a constitutional amendment requiring a balanced federal budget. \\n  \\n The former governor touts his success in balancing the budget in Minnesota while in office, but Democrats have been quick to point out that he left behind a projected $5 billion deficit. \\n  \\n \"I think it\\'s ironic that he\\'s talking about a fiscal plan for the entire country when he left his state a mess,\" current Minnesota Gov. Mark Dayton told the Associated Press. \"He decided he was going to leave and left it to his successor. They knew they were going to kick this down the road.\" \\n  \\n To prove his goal of 5 percent growth is attainable, Pawlenty pointed to eras of growth under the Reagan administration and the Clinton administration. Some pundits have pointed out that those periods of growth followed tax increases -- while Pawlenty is advocating for cuts across the board. On top of that, the Washington Post points out that as a share of GDP, taxes are currently lower than they were at any time during the Reagan or Clinton years. \\n  \\n Mark Robyn, an economist with the nonpartisan Tax Foundation, said that tax rates during those periods were only \"one piece of the puzzle.\" \\n  \\n \"There are a lot of variables that go into the macro economy,\" he told Hotsheet. \"Economists on both sides try to reconcile their views with data that agrees with them. Ultimately, presidents probably get way too much credit for a good economy and get way too much blame for a bad economy.\" \\n  \\n Robyn continued, \"It\\'s impossible for me to say whether Pawlenty\\'s plan will cause us to have some great economic boom.\" \\n  \\n If Pawlenty did, in fact, reduce rates and close tax loopholes in a revenue-neutral way, \"that would be a fairly significant change from what we have now, in a good sense,\" Robyn said. But, he added, that\\'s a tough promise to keep. \\n  \\n \"A lot of politicians will talk about that kind of stuff, but when it comes down to it, the politics becomes very difficult,\" Robyn said. \\n  \\n Pawlenty is far from the only politician calling for significant tax reform, however. Just today, Mr. Obama called for tax reform as part of a plan for long-term economic stability. Reports this year indicate Mr. Obama wants to keep his reforms revenue neutral. \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  |||||',\n",
              " '\\nGlobal warming alarmists are howling in outrage as Charles Krauthammer followed up a surgical takedown of global warming alarmism in his Washington Post column last Thursday with a similarly brilliant appearance on Fox Fox News’ O’Reilly Factor last night. For all the alarmists’ collective outrage, they have yet to identify a single error in what Krauthammer wrote and said. In the process, they have perfectly illustrated the difference between global warming skepticism, which relies on scientific evidence, and global warming alarmism, which relies on name-calling and temper tantrums.\\n\\nKrauthammer began his Washington Post column by expressing concern about human carbon dioxide emissions. He followed that up by pointing out the virtues of critical inquiry and the Scientific Method. In particular, he pointed out several global warming subtopics in which alarmists have been wrong on the facts. Krauthammer documented how hurricanes have become less frequent and severe, how tornadoes have similarly moderated, how climate models show global warming should increase rather than decrease California rainfall, and how alarmist computer models consistently predict far more warming than occurs in the real world.\\n\\nConcluding his article, Krauthammer noted how global warming alarmists typically respond to such evidence and factual data by attempting to silence scientific dissent through bullying tactics rather than scientific debate.\\n\\nTwitter photo posted by global warming activist Brad Johnson\\n\\nAs if intentionally attempting to prove Krauthammer correct, global warming alarmists have responded to Krauthammer’s column and O’Reilly appearance with shrill outrage, bullying tactics, and not a single shred of scientific data to contradict Krauthammer’s long list of scientific arguments. In a response that perfectly summed up the alarmist response. Time magazine senior editor Jeffrey Kluger repeatedly called Krauthammer an “unfrozen caveman,” failed to present any scientific data to contradict Krauthammer’s, and concluded by appealing to an abstract notion of “settled science.”\\n\\nThis leads one to wonder when the science became “settled.” Was it seven years ago when alarmists claimed global warming would reduce the frequency and severity of Arctic cold fronts reaching the United States, or this winter when they blame an increase in such repeated Arctic cold fronts on global warming? Was it three weeks ago when Time claimed global warming is bringing an end to snowfall, or two weeks ago when every state but Florida had snow on the ground and alarmists blamed it on global warming? Was it in 2007 when alarmists claimed global warming was melting Antarctic ice sheets, or in 2013 when they said global warming is causing record Antarctic ice extent? Was it in 1998 when alarmist computer models predicted dramatic warming during the following 16 years, or today after no such warming has occurred?\\n\\nWhen Charles Krauthammer and others ask such questions, one would expect global warming advocates who feel secure in their supporting scientific evidence to present the evidence and let the science do the talking. When prominent global warming advocates such as Barack Obama, John Kerry, and Jeffrey Kluger respond instead by engaging in juvenile name-calling – “flat earthers,” “unfrozen caveman” – this tells us where the science really stands. It’s like watching a spoiled three-year-old respond to his parents’ logical admonition to not eat sugar all day by flailing himself on the floor and throwing a three-hour temper tantrum. It may make for good theatrics, but it hardly addresses the sound science behind his parents’ admonition.\\n\\nYear after year, I have invited many of the most prominent advocates of a global warming crisis to make their scientific case at the Heartland Institute’s International Conference on Climate Change. Year after year, the alarmists shy away from the science and resort instead to the sort of long-distance name-calling that Time magazine launched against Charles Krauthammer. Their name-calling temper tantrums may help them vent their anger and rage at being proven wrong by the science, but it doesn’t change the fact that they are continually proven wrong by the science.\\n\\nWhile global warming alarmists ramp up their unscientific temper tantrums, Charles Krauthammer’s sound science looks better with each passing day.',\n",

              " \"A second female employee at the Washington County Jail in Hillsboro, Oregon, has been accused of having sex with the same inmate — a man held on charges that include failing to register as a sex offender. Brett Robinson, 32, was arrested Tuesday after a grand jury indicted her on charges of custodial sexual misconduct. She was later released after posting $120,000 bail. The revelation comes about a month after Washington County Jail employee Jill Curry, 38, was arrested on similar charges. 'Romantic rivals:' Brett Robinson (left), 32, a staffer at an Oregon jail, was arrested August 19 for allegedly having sex with the same inmate who allegedly had a trsyt with her colleague, Jill Curry, (right) 38, who was arrested last month. The Oregonian reported that both women worked as civilian jail service technicians whose duties included booking and control room operations. The Washington County sheriff's office said it is reviewing jail operations in light of the allegations against its staff. A spokesman, Sgt. Bob Ray, said Curry and Robinson did not know about one another's contact with the inmate. The jail holds 572 inmates and has a staff of 180 corrections deputies and civilian workers. Jill Curry, 38, was arrested July 16 on charges of first-degree custodial misconduct with an inmate. During her arraignment three weeks later, the long-time jail employee was charged with more than two dozen criminal counts, including identity theft. She pleaded not guilty and is due back in court next Monday, reported Hillsboro Tribune. The 38-year-old woman has been working within the sheriff's office since October 2004. Curry's indictment stated that the jail staffer had sex numerous time with the inmate in question between May 25 and July 3. Mrs Curry is married to a sheriff's deputy, who has since filed for divorce. According to officials, the allegations against Brett Robinson came to light as a result of the Curry investigation. ‘I consider allegations that involve a second Jail staff member in this case extraordinarily serious,’ said Sheriff Pat Garrett. ‘Addressing these issues demands immediate changes and a thorough, holistic review of protocols within the jail. Both efforts are under way. ‘. Robinson, who has been working at the jail since January 2013, was placed on administrative leave July 30. The following day, she was placed on unpaid leave based on the facts of the case. The sheriff's office has been tight-lipped about the details of the investigations concerning Curry and Robinson, declining to specify where and under what circumstances the alleged sexual encounters took place. The name of the inmate at the center of the controversy has not been released, but sheriff's officials revealed that he is facing a slew of charges in connection to four separate cases. The unidentified suspect, who is listed as a victim in the probes of the two jail employees, is accused of failing to register as a sex offender; tempering with a witness; sexual harassment and second-degree assault.\",\n",

              " \"A financier's wife has been awarded £337 million in what could be Britain’s biggest ever divorce settlement – but her legal team have hinted that she may appeal for more. Sir Chris Hohn has been told to hand over the sum following the collapse of his 15-year marriage to Jamie Cooper-Hohn. The pair – who have homes in London, the US and West Indies – had fought over assets totalling more than £700 million at the High Court. Payout: Jamie Cooper-Hohn (left) , the American wife of financier Sir Chris Hohn (right) has been awarded £337 million by a High Court judge following their divorce battle. The settlement was revealed in a hearing yesterday – during which Mrs Cooper-Hohn’s lawyers asked the judge how long they have to request an appeal. Sources close to Mrs Cooper-Hohn indicated that she wants to examine the precise percentage she has been awarded. Sir Chris’s representatives told the court they were anxious to ‘move on with things [but the] wife is not’. The long-running case had bordered on farce at times, with Sir Chris, 47, accusing Mrs Cooper-Hohn of seeking maintenance payments towards a dog that never existed. What Jamie Cooper-Hohn could afford to buy with her £337 million divorce settlement. Sir Chris, who was born in Addlestone, Surrey, met his American wife, 49, when the pair studied at Harvard Business School. She told an earlier hearing that she initially spurned his advances, but the pair later bonded over the film Malcolm X. They married in Washington DC in 1995 and had four children – triplets, now aged 12, and an older child of 15. They split up in December 2012, with Mrs Cooper-Hohn divorcing Sir Chris in April 2013 – but the decree nisi has never been made absolute. Cahrity work: During the trial, Mrs Cooper-Hohn  told the judge that she worked long hours on behalf of their charitable foundation and travelled. The court heard earlier this year that the couple lived ‘modest’ lives, with Sir Chris’s lifestyle described as more ‘Swatch’ watch than ‘jet-set’. Mrs Cooper-Hohn said she should get half of the couple’s fortune because the wealth was created as a result of their ‘partnership’. Sir Chris said she should receive a quarter. Mrs Cooper-Hohn claimed their joint assets were around £849 million – and added that her ex-husband was worth at least £872 million from personal assets and his hedge fund, for a combined total of £1.72billion. However, Sir Chris, who was knighted in the Queen’s birthday honours this year, claimed he is worth a mere £67 million. Investor: During the trial, Sir Chris had described himself as one of the 'top ten' career investors. One of the country’s biggest philanthropists, Sir Chris has given more than £1 billion to charity through the Children’s Investment Fund Foundation, which is linked to his hedge fund. Mrs Cooper-Hohn told the court she had been the chairman of the venture, and was the inspiration behind her husband’s donations. She said: ‘When Chris and I first met, I asked him what he wanted to do. He said “I don’t mind as long as I make a lot of money”.’ Sir Chris – a so-called ‘non-dom’ who is legally based outside of the UK – countered that he had wanted to help others from an early age. He added: ‘I learned very early on that you can’t take money with you and that it doesn’t bring happiness. The basis for my claim [to retain 75 per cent of the disputed fortune] is that I have created all the wealth through expertise, effort and sweat and blood.’ Mrs Justice Roberts has yet to deliver a detailed ruling on the dispute, but a draft version has been given to Sir Chris and Mrs Cooper-Hohn and their legal teams. The £337 million award is thought to be the biggest of its kind ever made by a judge in England. The amount spent on litigation is believed to have run into the millions, too – but it remains unclear who will foot the bill. A judge involved in one of the couple’s earlier hearings had wondered aloud about the fees. ‘God knows the cost of being here,’ Mr Justice Holman had said. ‘I know these people are immensely wealthy ... the costs just roll off the back of the duck like a drop.’ Alison Hawes, a family law specialist at the firm Irwin Mitchell, said yesterday’s settlement was ‘certainly one of the highest’. However, bigger payouts may have been awarded in private hearings. The wife of late Russian oligarch Boris Berezovsky reportedly accepted a deal between £165million and £220million three years ago. Boris Berezovsky (pictured) reportedly gave his former wife Galina Besharova  between £165 million and £220 million in a settlement. A number of big money divorce cases resulting in huge payouts has given London the reputation of being 'the divorce capital of the world'. It is widely believed that it capital's judges offer larger settlements for wives, with proceedings taking place relatively quickly. Generous settlements include that awarded to Heather Mills following the break down of her marriage to Sir Paul McCartney 2008. Following the four-year marriage, Miss Mills received £24.3million. That same year Phil Collins's ex-wife Orianne Cevey was awarded a £25million settlement. Bernie Ecclestone reportedly paid ex-wife Slavica £750m in a private settlement. In 2006 Beverley Charman, the former wife of insurance magnate John Charman was awarded a £48million settlement by the English courts in proceedings which took two years. Mr Charman appealed the decision but the pay out, which made legal history at the time, was upheld in 2007. The businessman claimed he was penniless and could not afford to pay his ex-wife anything, prompting a bitter dispute after she alleged he was worth millions. The late Russian oligarch, Boris Berezovsky, featured in a multi-million pound case three years ago - when it was reported that his former wife Galina Besharova had agreed to accept between £165 million and £220 million as part of a settlement. Last November Michelle Young was awarded a £20million sum after parting ways with her 'bankrupt' husband Scot Young.\",\n",

The 81-year-old \"Killing Me Softly\" singer, who was supposed to be receiving the foundation\\'s Lifetime Achievement Award, was able to get off the stage on her own, per her manager, and was taken by ambulance to a local hospital. \"She suffered a stroke a few years ago,\" her rep tells People. \"She didn\\'t feel well, so it was best to take her to the hospital.\" The rep tells TMZ that Flack—who apparently got \"extremely dizzy\" as she went out to accept her award—seems to be OK and has since been released from the hospital, but more tests are being done to see if doctors can figure out why she got sick so suddenly.

UN authorities have confirmed the news, diplomats tell the BBC. The agreement allows the country to continue enriching uranium to 5%. As for the other side of the deal, \"the sanctions iceberg against Iran is melting,\" says Iran\\'s nuclear head. Assuming the EU is satisfied with the enrichment cuts, Iran should today be allowed to restart petrochemical exports as well as trade in gold, meaning billions of dollars for its economy, the BBC notes. Under the deal, Iran is also required to convert half of its existing 20% enriched uranium to oxide; the other half must be diluted to 5% enrichment, CBS News reports. In exchange for the dilution, Iran will gain access to some of its frozen foreign assets worth as much as $4.2 billion, the New York Times reports.',\n",

              " 'If your veterinarian has identified a medical condition that requires special treatment, medication, or other interventions, make sure that you follow the veterinarian’s instructions. If your dog’s elimination problems are related to a medical condition, they will not improve until he is cured. Contact your veterinarian immediately if your dog’s condition worsens or does not improve despite treatment. You can get your dog to stop eliminating inside the house by gradually introducing grass to the type of surface your dog prefers to use. For example, if your dog prefers to urinate on carpet, place a piece of carpet or a small rug in your back yard. Allow your dog to use the rug, but add a handful of grass to the carpet every day. When the carpet is completely covered in grass and your dog is still using it, remove the carpet. Your dog should be used to using a grassy surface and continue eliminating on the grass. Simple changes to your daily routine or to your dog’s environment may help to ease some of his fears and anxieties. After you have identified the source of your dog’s fear, you can take steps to try to eliminate or reduce it. For example, if your dog is frightened by the sound of passing cars when you take him out for a walk, try taking a quieter route or taking your walk at a time of day when there is less traffic. Some dogs just don’t like to go outside when the weather is bad. You can help make the experience more tolerable for your dog by getting cold and/or wet weather gear for your dog. For example, if your dog does not like the feel of his paws in the snow, consider getting some boots for your dog to wear when you take him outside. Or, if your dog doesn’t like to get wet, consider getting him a raincoat to wear when it is raining. Some dogs have multiple reasons for why they are not housebroken or why they begin eliminating in the house after years of going outside. If your dog does not respond to your housebreaking efforts and there is no medical reason for your dog’s issues, you may want to consider hiring a certified professional dog trainer to help you housebreak your adult dog.',\n",

Isaac Choi, the former CEO of short-lived tech startup WrkRiot—which developed software to be used in job searches before its closure in September 2016—pleaded guilty to wire fraud in federal court Monday after lying about his background and defrauding employees out of wages, reports the San Francisco Chronicle. According to prosecutors, 36-year-old Choi stopped paying employees shortly after WrkRiot\\'s founding (the company also went by the names 1for.one and JobSonic) and forged wire transfer confirmations to suggest payments were coming. As former employee Penny Kim wrote in a 2016 Medium post, it was an intern who discovered wire transfer confirmations sent to 17 employees were actually photoshopped, per the San Francisco Weekly. All this went down amid greater chaos at the startup. Kim said Choi borrowed $50,000 from one employee after claiming $2 million he planned to invest was tied up in offshore accounts. \"In total, Choi collected hundreds of thousands of dollars from his own employees through false representations about the company\\'s financial health and his own ability to financially support WrkRiot in its early stages of development,\" reads an indictment filed in June 2017, per the San Jose Mercury News.

Naeem Williams, 35, and his daughter Talia Williams's stepmother, Delilah Williams, assaulted the little girl almost daily during the seven months she lived with them at their military home in 2005. They used both belts and their fists to beat the youngster - in at least one case, until they 'felt a bone crack'. During the fatal attack, Naeem Williams punched Talia in the chest, leaving  visible imprints. Murder: Naeem Williams (left) has been sentenced to life in prison after beating his five-year-old daughter, Talia Williams (right), to death in an attack so brutal she was left with knuckle imprints on her tiny chest. The U.S. Department of Justice later sought the death penalty against Williams for the murder of his daughter, which occurred at the married couple's  home at Wheeler Army Air Force Base in Wahiawa. However, last year, the jury that had earlier convicted Williams of\\xa0murder\\xa0deliberated for a week on his sentence -\\xa0either life in prison without parole or execution - before declaring they were deadlocked. Because the panel could not reach a consensus, the judge was required to sentence Williams to a life term, capping what was the first death penalty case to go to trial in Hawaii since it became a state. On Friday, a federal judge in Honolulu fulfilled his task to imprison the killer for life. Now, Williams - whose wife worked at a day-care facility at the Army base - will spend the rest of his life behind bars. Abused: Williams and his daughter's stepmother, Delilah Williams, assaulted the little girl almost daily during the seven months she lived with them at their military home in 2005. Above, Talia in a family photo. Killers: The married couple used both belts and their fists to beat the youngster - in at least one case, until they 'felt a bone crack'. Above Naeem (left) and Delilah Williams (right) are pictured in their police mug shots. Although Hawaii's territorial government abolished capital punishment in 1957, Talia's murder took place on Army property, and the case was tried in federal court, where the death penalty is allowed. During a long and emotional trial last year, jurors heard graphic testimony about how Williams and his spouse often beat Talia at Schofield Barracks, partly because of her bathroom accidents. Taking to the stand, Delilah Williams said that she and her husband had decided to pull her step-daughter out of elementary school because they were worried that officials would notice the abuse. 'She started having marks on her body,' Delilah Williams said, adding that she and Naeem Williams would often curse at Talia, as well as calling her names and hitting her almost daily. In shocking testimony, Delilah Williams told of how her husband had bound his daughter to a bedpost with duct tape, before beating her with a belt while she had a 'pleading look' on her face. She said that she had attempted the taping routine once herself, but had found it was not effective because the girl could squirm around. 'It required too much effort,' she added. Although the step-mother delivered most of her testimony was delivered with an even, calm voice, she sounded like she was going to cry when she described a beating  on June 29, 2005. Delilah Williams said she had come home from work that day to find Talia had wet herself. 'I started stomping on her,' she told the court through glistening eyes. 'I just continued stomping on her until it felt like a bone cracked under my foot and she defecated on herself.' Victim: Naeem Williams will spend the rest of his life behind bars for the murder of Talia (pictured, left and right, before her death in July 2005). Delilah Williams was previously sentenced to 20 years in prison. She forced the child to sit on a toilet and pushed on her stomach so hard that a toilet pipe broke, causing a leak. She said she then grabbed Talia by the hair and slammed her head against a wall. Delilah Williams was jailed for 20 years in 2014 as part of a plea agreement for the July 2005 murder. During proceedings leading up to Naeem Williams's death penalty sentencing last June, his family, including his daughter, nine, and  son, 11, testified that they love him and that his life has value. Williams read a statement to jurors apologizing for killing Talia and asking them to let him live.\",\n",

They seemed to have just wasted a lot of time filming outside shots while the two \"heroes\" drove around in the desert, and Bradbury talks nonsense for about 10 minutes.

              " '\\nGoogle’s Maps team introduced three new technologies on Wednesday: a feature to save offline maps in the Android Maps app, advanced 3-D models of entire cities in Google Earth, and a new Android-controlled “Street View Trekker” backpack for capturing Street View images where bikes, cars and planes can’t go. \\n  \\n Let’s start with the backpack, the most provocative of the three technologies introduced. \\n  \\n Street View Trekker \\n  \\n The Trekker is essentially a miniaturized version of all the gear Google packs into its Street View cars and tricycles, including a 15-lens camera that can shoot 46MP images. The Trekker, however, is controlled by an Android smartphone plugged into the pack, which is surprisingly lightweight given its size. \\n  \\n I tried it on for myself, and was impressed by how easy it was to move around with the Trekker on. \\n  \\n Luc Vincent, a Street View engineering director, recently took a Trekker with him on a ski trip in Tahoe, collecting images that could be used for Street View shots of the slopes. Of wearing the backpack while skiing, Vincent said, “It’s really not so bad. You’ve got to be a bit careful obviously, but, hey, it works.” \\n  \\n Not everyone, however, gets the idea: “A kid came up to me and said, ‘Hey, why don’t you use a GoPro camera instead,” Vincent said. \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n Google says only a handful of the backpacks currently exist, and unlike the other products it demoed Wednesday, the Trekker isn’t a consumer technology that anyone can try out for him or herself. The company plans on using the Trekkers to map out castles, ruins, hiking trails, and the Grand Canyon — places where wheeled vehicles and planes can’t go. \\n  \\n Google Earth’s New 3-D Maps \\n  \\n Using an iPad, Peter Birch, a Google Earth product manager, demoed a coming Google Earth update that showed a 3-D model of San Francisco displaying every single building in the city, as well as plant life, statues and other landmarks, each with it own modeling. A view of AT&T Park, home of the San Francisco Giants, showed the ballpark and its stands, scoreboard and lighting system fully modeled. \\n  \\n Birch wouldn’t say exactly when the advanced 3-D modeling was coming, but said it was coming to iOS, Android and desktop versions of Google Earth soon, and that major metropolitan areas would be the first to get the 3-D treatment. \\n  \\n “The goal is to model the world in 3-D,” he said in the presentation. “What we’re doing is we’re using automated technology to extract 3-D from aerial images.” The aerial images are shot by a fleet of contracted planes equipped with custom, Google-designed camera systems that take 45-degree angle shots in each of the cardinal directions, as well as straight down. \\n  \\n An automated process called stereo photogrammetry uses algorithms to create 3-D models from the overhead photos. Those models are then overlaid with other images, colors and textures to give the models a photo-realistic look. \\n  \\n “Every single building here is modeled and that’s important because we’re trying to create magic here,” Birch said. “We’re trying to create that illusion that you’re flying over the city.” \\n  \\n Previously, a few landmark buildings were modeled in Google Earth, but those buildings were few and far between. Birch showed a view of San Francisco as it currently looks in the software, and only City Hall and the Transamerica tower had 3-D models, while all in between was flat. \\n  \\n Birch said that Google hasn’t yet decided which cities would get modeled first, but that the company hopes to have “communities of over 300 million people modeled by the end of the year.” \\n  \\n The advancement of Google Earth’s 3-D modeling capabilities will come to all Google Earth apps — desktop, Android and Apple iOS. Wednesday’s demo could rightly be construed as a move to show Apple what it will be missing out on — and what it will have to compete with — if indeed Apple ditches Google Maps in the next version of iOS, as is widely believed to happen as early as next week at Apple’s World Wide Developers Conference. \\n  \\n Offline Maps on Android \\n  \\n The ability to save maps for offline viewing might not be as exciting as 3-D models of entire cities, or the Trekker backpack, but this new Google Maps for Android feature might end up being the announced feature we all use the most. \\n  \\n The Google Maps app for Android, not iOS, will receive an update in the coming weeks that will allow it to save maps so they can be accessed by users when they’re unable to connect to the cloud. Anyone who has ever tried to use Google Maps without a Wi-Fi connection or wireless signal knows how fruitless it is to actually use the app. Of course, offline apps have to be saved ahead of time — so there will be some planning involved to make this useful. \\n  \\n Rita Chen, a Google Maps product manager, demoed the feature on a Motorola Android tablet, saving a map of London for offline use. It worked just as advertised. \\n  \\n Google said the feature isn’t yet coming to the Maps app in Apple’s iOS, which is currently powered by Google Maps. The question of Google and Apple’s mapping future, or lack thereof, hung over the event the entire time. When Google took questions from the press, many reporters tried to get Google to confirm or deny that Apple was striking out on a mapping effort of its own. \\n  \\n Brian McClendon, a vice president of engineering who leads the Google Maps and Earth team, wasn’t giving in to the pressure, however. \\n  \\n “I’m very proud of Google Maps services and they’re available on all devices today and we’ll continue to make them as widely available as possible,” McClendon said. “We would like to get all services on all platforms.” ||||| Google Inc. unveiled an expansion of its Google Maps and Google Earth services, upping the ante ahead of an anticipated new mapping service from rival Apple Inc. \\n  \\n Google unveiled an expansion of its Google Maps and Google Earth services-including 3-dimensional maps-in a move that upps the ante ahead of an anticipated new mapping service from rival Apple. Photo: Google \\n  \\n The search giant said Wednesday it would start showing three-dimensional images for entire metropolitan areas in Google Earth. Up to this point, the service had shown 3-D images only of some buildings. Google said it would eventually also make the more-robust 3-D imagery available on Google Maps and to software developers. \\n  \\n In addition, Google said it would soon make Google Maps available on devices that run on its Android mobile operating system, even during times when the device doesn\\'t have an Internet connection because the user has poor wireless reception. Currently, the service works only if the device is connected to a wireless network. \\n  \\n Google\\'s announcements, made at an event in San Francisco Wednesday, come as the Internet search giant and Apple are locked in a battle for smartphone and tablet users and the hundreds of thousands of software developers who make apps for the devices. Maps are considered to be a future battleground, with Apple becoming the newest major entrant. \\n  \\n Enlarge Image Close Google Google Earth will now show 3-D images for entire metropolitan areas. The service previously just showed 3-D images for some buildings.. \\n  \\n Wednesday\\'s event, which included no major news, appeared aimed at showing how much Google had invested in improving the service over the past seven years and implying that it would be difficult to replicate. \\n  \\n Google is currently nearly unchallenged in digital mapping for consumers, and thousands of developers pay the company to incorporate Google Maps into their websites. Google doesn\\'t charge developers for incorporating Google Maps on Android and Apple mobile devices. Many developers use Google Maps to show app users their location on a map and how close they are to their friends and restaurants, for instance. \\n  \\n Apple currently preloads Google Maps on its iPhones and iPads. But Apple has been putting the pieces in place to offer a mapping service of its own and to replace Google Maps as the default mapping service on its devices, people familiar with the matter have said. \\n  \\n Apple could preview the new software, which is expected to be part of its next mobile-operating system, as soon as next week at its annual developer conference, one person familiar with the plan has said. Apple plans to encourage app developers to embed its maps inside their applications. \\n  \\n \"There\\'s a race between Google and Apple to develop the next killer features on their mobile platforms,\" said Robin Thurston, chief product officer of MapMyFitness Inc., which develops mobile apps that let people track their fitness activities on Google-powered maps and share them with friends. \\n  \\n Mr. Thurston said he expects his company will develop a version of its service using Apple\\'s future maps software. \\n  \\n On Wednesday, Google vice president of engineering Brian McClendon declined to directly address Apple\\'s mapping efforts, other than to say Google would continue to work on providing comprehensive mapping service to Apple device users. \\n  \\n Android smartphones have one key advantage over the iPhone when it comes to mapping: They have a built-in Google turn-by-turn navigation service that acts like an in-car GPS, while the iPhone doesn\\'t—the result of disagreements between the companies over how such a service would be displayed. \\n  \\n Google product manager Peter Birch said that by the end of the year Google\\'s 3-D coverage, aided by imagery from cameras mounted on Google\\'s own fleet of planes, would extend to areas with a combined population of 300 million people. \\n  \\n Google didn\\'t disclose the names of cities for which 3-D imagery would be available but added that the new feature would be made available on Apple mobile devices as well as those powered by Android. \\n  \\n Write to Amir Efrati at amir.efrati@wsj.com \\n  \\n A version of this article appeared June 7, 2012, on page B4 in the U.S. edition of The Wall Street Journal, with the headline: Google Ups Ante as Map Battle Looms. |||||',\n",

A shamed police officer killed himself just hours before he was due to be charged with child sex offences, an inquest was told today. PC Gareth Gricks, 53, was facing allegations of paedophilia in Thailand and a sexual assault on a young woman in the UK. He had already been sacked after 19 years’ service with Norfolk Police and was set to be charged with nine offences. But on the day he was due to answer bail the divorced grandfather was discovered hanged in the garage at his home. Recording a verdict of suicide, coroner Jacqueline Lake said: 'I will record a conclusion of suicide. I am satisfied he took his own life.' The coroner read a statement from PC Gricks’ mother Shirley Matthews, which revealed he had been 'finding life difficult' before his death. It read: 'It was clear that he had been finding life difficult because of things that were happening in his personal life. 'I have no doubt that he was trying to put on a brave face for the sake of his family and friends. But I believe he was feeling low and depressed in the weeks before he died. 'Gareth was a very popular person who will be much missed by his family and friends.' PC Gricks hanged himself at his home in Dunton, Norfolk, on August 6 this year and his body was discovered by a member of his family. The inquest in Norwich was told police officers found notes to Mr Gricks’ family and friends making it clear he intended to take his own life. PC Gricks had been told he would be charged with three counts of arranging or facilitating the commission of a child sex offence and one of making indecent images of children. He was also facing five counts of sexual assault against an adult female in this country. Investigators believed he was using an online forum to make contact with girls under the age of 16. Around 100 indecent images are said to have been found on his computer. Misconduct: Gareth Gricks was dismissed from Norfolk Police in response to the allegations. PC Gricks, who was based at King’s Lynn, was first arrested in May, the day after he returned from a holiday in Thailand after allegations were made to police. He was released on bail but sacked for gross misconduct on July 15. Norfolk Constabulary today declined to comment on the conclusion of the inquest. The force confirmed none of the alleged offences took place while he was on duty. Speaking at the time of Mr Gricks’ death, Norfolk Temporary Assistant Chief Constable Nick Dean said the force took 'immediate action' after being told about the alleged offences. The officer was arrested and suspended before being dismissed by the Chief Constable. He added: 'As a result of his death, there can be no criminal prosecution and the investigation effectively ceases. 'However, in recognition of his role and the serious nature of the offences he was due to face, it is right and proper that this information is placed in the public domain - not only to demonstrate police action but also to give victims of sexual abuse a voice when this cannot be achieved through the judicial process.'\",\n",

              " '\"Scarface\" has a major cult following even now, 22 years after its release.\\n\\nIt has also been widely criticized as being very tacky, unrefined, over-the-top and all bloated up! These are people who compare Scarface to The Godfather movies. It is true that on the technical front, (cinematography, screenplay, direction, etc.) Scarface is way behind \\'The Godfather\\'.\\n\\nBut it is also true, that what Scarface has and some other gangster movies lack, is the rawness, the sheer crude approach of the gangsters. The Latino gangsters in this movie look much more menacing and real than any of the polished Italian or Irish gangsters from other gangster classics like \\'The Godfather\\' or \\'Goodfellas\\'. This is one of the major winning points of Scarface and I strongly believe that this fact has been written off as \"tackiness\" by most critics! I have seen the original 1932 Scarface, and I must say that both these movies are way too different from each other and should be seen as two different movies instead of praising the original over the \"remake\"! \\n\\nAl Pacino has been criticized to be over-the-top and loud in this movie. But how about considering that that is precisely the way the film-makers wanted Tony Montana\\'s character to be! He is this angry young man who takes hasty decisions and throws fits of tantrum every other minute! He is not the calm Michael Corleone here. He is Tony Montana, a very tacky, uneducated individual who doesn\\'t really think much and gets angry all the time!\\n\\nThere is definitely a very 80s feel to this movie. The soundtrack is all 80s! I love some of the songs, including \\'Gina and Elvira\\'s theme\\', \\'Push it to the limit\\' and the title track instrumental.\\n\\nThere are some memorable and beautifully shot sequences, including the famous chainsaw scene, the Rebenga hit, the first meeting with Sosa and Tony\\'s visit to his mother\\'s.\\n\\nAbout the performances: Al Pacino is brilliant as the angry Cuban refugee. He has reportedly mentioned that he enjoyed playing Tony Montana the most in his entire career. And it really does seem like he has enjoyed himself thoroughly in all his scenes! One wonders what \"Scarface\" would be like without Pacino. I just couldn\\'t imagine anyone else portraying Tony Montana and in all probabilities, the film wouldn\\'t be as effective without him!\\n\\nSteven Bauer shines as Tony\\'s friend Manny.\\n\\nRobert Loggia is wonderful as Tony\\'s boss, Lopez. So is F. Murray Abraham (as Omar) in a small role.\\n\\nThen there is some eye-candy in the form of Elvira played by Michelle Pfeiffer. She looks beautiful and is adequate in her role.\\n\\nThe director does go a bit overboard during a particular part in the climax. Without revealing anything, I would only say that that was the only little part that suffers due to improper handling.\\n\\n\"Scarface\" is definitely one of the most entertaining and one of the best gangster movies to ever come out.

              " 'Twitter Co-Founder Biz Stone revealed his top-secret new startup Jelly, a mobile app that enables users to ask short questions of their social network through pictures. For instance, Stone snapped a photo of an art piece in San Francisco, asked his network what it was, and got a few dozen answers. \\n  \\n Since this morning’s announcement, there’s been a swirl of confusion and criticism about Jelly, especially because it seemed odd to limit an information utility to short questions within one’s own relatively small social network. \\n  \\n But, after speaking to Stone, it appears that Jelly has a much more unique and ambitious purpose than we’ve come to expect from web utilities. The primary goal of Jelly is to increase empathy, and is built more for the answerer than the asker. \\n  \\n “Using Jelly to help people is as much more important than using Jelly to search for help. If we’re successful, then we’re going to introduce into the daily muscle memory of smartphone users, everyone, that there’s this idea that there’s other people that need their help right now. \\n  \\n “Let’s make the world a more empathetic place by teaching that there’s other people around them that need help.” \\n  \\n To be sure, Jelly is still a utility. I successfully used it this morning to answer a math question: \\n  \\n The same could apply to asking about what to wear, where to travel, or how to decorate one’s room. In one anecdote, COO Kevin Thau’s niece solicited some art advice for an acrylic painting, which eventually got forwarded all the way to the art director of a friend and director of TV’s House, Greg Yaitanes. \\n  \\n “That art director answered it brilliantly,” he gushes. “In what world does a 14-year-old girl in Florida get a professional answer from an art director?” \\n  \\n Success for Jelly is about creating a comprehensive question-and-answer network that users tap throughout the day, especially in their downtime, such as while waiting in line at the grocery store. \\n  \\n “All these people are working on artificial intelligence. How about just intelligence? There’s 7 billion people; there’s a lot of intelligence out there.” \\n  \\n But, the search engine seems almost instrumental. Biz’s stream-of-conscious explanation is worth quoting in full: \\n  \\n Beyond being a very useful search engine, like I said before, it creates this circle of empathy, where people realize that ‘Oh, there’s other people who need my help and I can actually help them and they’ll feel good about it and they’ll get trained to thinking about helping other people. And, maybe that’ll even jump outside of the app and just into the real world and they’ll start looking around and helping people and wouldn’t that be great? \\n  \\n With this, the format of Jelly makes more sense. Offering knowledge in an instant is the shortest path to helping. Jelly is explicitly discouraging discussions or any long-form back-and-forth. Just quick answers, a shot of personal dopamine, and off to the rest of the day. \\n  \\n Jelly is the first major application that I’m aware of to be built for the person helping, not the one seeking help. It’s this counterintuitive proposition that makes Jelly so intriguing. More importantly, Stone is no stranger to wild success. Few would have ever thought Twitter would become a staple of modern-day media. \\n  \\n Yes, Jelly is ambitious, but it’s being directed by someone who has the track record to actually make it happen. It’s new territory, and we’ll be following his grand experiment. \\n  \\n “We just kind of increase that global empathy quotient just a bit in our lifetime, and wouldn’t that be great?” ||||| Twitter cofounder Biz Stone is taking another crack at changing the world. \\n  \\n Stone and a seven-person startup launched a question-and-answer style social networking app on Tuesday called Jelly, available for free on iOS and Android. The app asks users to submit questions alongside a picture captured from their phone\\'s camera. \\n  \\n See also: 10 Best iPhone Apps of 2013 \\n  \\n Connections from the user\\'s Facebook or Twitter accounts can then respond to the question through the app. \\n  \\n \"In a world where 140 characters is considered a maximum length, a picture really is worth a thousand words,\" Stone wrote in a post on Jelly\\'s blog. \"Images are in the foreground of the Jelly experience because they add depth and context to any question.\" \\n  \\n Users can respond to a friend\\'s question with a link, by drawing on the original image, or simply using text. Users can also forward questions using text message — so in theory, you don\\'t need to download Jelly to help your social connections gather answers to their questions. \\n  \\n The app provides a service that already exists on a number of other platforms, including Twitter, the company Stone helped build (he left in 2011). Other sites, like Quora and Ask.com, already focus exclusively on question-and-answer style interactions. \\n  \\n But Stone said that Jelly was built with the expectation that users will help answer your questions — a feature other social sites like Facebook and Twitter aren\\'t primarily used for. Jelly\\'s mobile-only approach enhances its functionality, Stone added. \\n  \\n Jelly was born out of Stone\\'s passion for helping people; he believes the app can make an act of kindness relatively simple. After leaving Twitter, Stone spent time pondering how the world operated with so much connectivity. It was then that he stumbled upon the idea for Jelly with cofounder Ben Finkel. Prior to Jelly, Finkel cofounded Fluther, another question-and-answer service that Twitter acquired in December 2010. \\n  \\n \"I was trying to imagine, \\'What is the true promise of this newly, wonderfully connected society?\\'\" Stone said in an interview with Mashable. \"The only thing that I can think of that makes the most sense is people helping each other.\" \\n  \\n Jelly\\'s future may rest on two aspects of the app: the algorithm used to determine which users see which questions, and the information Jelly is bound to accumulate if users adopt the app. \\n  \\n The questions asked aren\\'t shared with all of a user\\'s social connections. A simple algorithm — jokingly referred to as the \"Finkel Rank\" after the cofounder — surfaces questions to the most relevant audience, Stone said. This algorithm will improve over time as the app collects more data on users and should help improve Jelly\\'s functionality. \\n  \\n Stone says the company is \"more about knowledge than information retrieval\" at the moment, but sometime down the road, popular questions will likely populate with answers within the app itself. A database of questions and subsequent answers could also help Jelly gain a foothold among its competitors. \\n  \\n Stone has been working on Jelly for almost a year since diverting his full attention away from the startup incubator Obvious Corporation, where he worked with fellow Twitter cofounder Ev Williams. Stone provided the early funding to get Jelly off the ground, but collected a round of capital in May from an impressive list of angel investors including Twitter cofounders Williams and Jack Dorsey, former Vice President Al Gore and Bono. \\n  \\n Jelly announced a permanent office in San Francisco in November. The app\\'s name was inspired by jellyfish, which have \"a loose network of nerves that act as a \\'brain\\' similar to the way we envision loosely distributed networks of people coordinating via Jelly to help each other,\" Stone wrote in the blog post. \\n  \\n Image: Andrew Burton/Getty Images ||||| For nearly a year famous person Biz Stone has dramatically teased us with his mysterious new app. He told us the app\\'s name -- Jelly -- and little else. \\n  \\n The tech world grew giddy with anticipation. Stone, you see, is one of the cofounders of Twitter -- another app with a funny name. It\\'s now worth billions. \\n  \\n Finally, on Tuesday Stone let us in on the secret. And Jelly turns out to be a ... a search engine? \\n  \\n Sort of. \\n  \\n Jelly is a new, free question and answer app for iPhones and Android phones. The app allows you to ask friends and friends-of-friends questions. You connect Jelly with your Facebook or Twitter account (or both) and then you take a photo and ask a related question. \\n  \\n The Huffington Post spoke to Stone by phone on Tuesday and asked him about the hype around his app, which has intensified in the months since he wrote a mysterious, vague blog post announcing his new venture. \\n  \\n Stone was modest about the all the publicity: \"Because of Twitter I\\'ve gained notoriety, so that\\'s given it a boost,\" Stone told HuffPost in an interview. \"It\\'s a blessing and a curse, because when we\\'ve been working on it we couldn\\'t do it without anyone watching.\" \\n  \\n Jelly is also backed by some big names, including Bono, Al Gore, LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman and Twitter co-founders/entrepreneurs Jack Dorsey and Evan Williams. The company is still small (there are eight employees) but Stone expects the app to be profitable, since, as he says, it\\'s \"a new way to search\" and search is a good business to be in. \\n  \\n Sure, it\\'s a good business to be in theoretically, but it\\'s a business that belongs to Google. If Jelly wants to challenge Google, it would have to revolutionize search. \\n  \\n Here\\'s how Jelly works: Say you\\'re walking along and see a building your don\\'t recognize. With Jelly, you would take a photo of the building and upload it, asking \"What is this building?\" In theory, at least one of your friends or someone in your extended friend group would know the answer and respond to you. People need to have Jelly to be able to see and answer questions, but you can forward a question to someone who doesn\\'t have Jelly if you want his or her help. \\n  \\n It\\'s hard to imagine what sort of question you\\'d prefer to ask Jelly instead of Google or a close friend. Although Jelly just launched, the app\\'s 50-or-so beta testers tended to ask three specific types of questions, Stone told HuffPost. Those questions were: \"What is this?\" \"Is this good?\" and \"How do I fix this?\" \\n  \\n Because a big part of the way Jelly works is based on its camera feature, these sorts of questions tend to work out well. \"People would take pictures of the back of their TiVos and other people would come in and circle the right plug,\" Stone told HuffPost. \\n  \\n The difference between asking a question on Jelly vs. asking it a regular social media app like Facebook or Twitter \"comes up to expectation,\" Stone says. \"People aren\\'t expected to give you a thoughtful answer on social media.\" On Jelly, however, the whole point is to get questions answered. \\n  \\n If Stone wants to know if the hat he bought his 2-year-old would be good for blocking out the sun, and he posted a photo of his son in the hat on Facebook asking if it was a good hat, he wouldn\\'t get direct answers, he says. \"I\\'d get answers like \\'He\\'s so cute,\\' or \\'He looks just like your wife,\\'\" Stone says. On Jelly, he argues, he\\'d get direct, thoughtful answers from people. \\n  \\n It\\'s not as if he couldn\\'t use Google and Facebook to get the answers he\\'s looking for, though. If he were to Google the best sun hats for toddlers he\\'d find hundreds of reviews. And if he were to ask a straightforward question on Facebook without including a photo of his son, he\\'d probably get better results as well. \\n  \\n The concept behind Jelly is nothing new. Sites like Quora, Ask and Yahoo Answers have all been offering ordinary people ways to ask and answer questions from all over the world. There are two main differences, though, (besides the ability to attach a photo), that Stone pointed out. One is that the people you\\'re asking are all \"trusted\" sources, since they\\'re all connected to you in some way. The second is that Jelly, unlike a site like Quora, is built around getting answers efficiently. \"We\\'re explicitly going away from encouraging discussions,\" Stone told HuffPost. \"It\\'s more like a search engine.\" \\n  \\n The goal of gathering direct answers to questions isn\\'t always obtained, however. For example, I saw one person who posted a photo of a dog on Jelly and asked what kind of dog it was. Out of the 18 answers I read, not one was a legitimate answer. Most people wrote that the dog was \"cute\" or \"sleepy,\" when the person was clearly looking to determine the dog\\'s breed. How can you blame anyone, though? That person was probably better off doing a reverse image search on Google or searching on Google with a description of the dog\\'s appearance. \\n  \\n I also encountered someone on Jelly who asked what sort of fish a toy he photographed was meant to resemble. \"Google \\'unicorn fish,\\'\" someone answered. Unfortunately, Googling defeats Jelly\\'s purpose. \\n  \\n Besides building a business, obviously, Stone\\'s goal with Jelly is to \"create a way for people to help each other.\" \\n  \\n \"I can\\'t help but think that now that humanity is at its most connected in history: What is the point of a connected society?\" Stone philosophized to HuffPost. \"The true promise of a connected society has got to be people helping each other.\" |||||',\n",

Australian media reported that in 2007, the then 14 year old boy was making so much money selling non-existent laptops, mobile phones and watches on eBay he could afford to book a $4300-a-night penthouses overlooking Sydney Harbour, fly friends interstate for lavish parties and hire limousines to take him to the beach. A spokesman for the Commonwealth Bank of Australia confirmed to CNN that the woman from the south coast of New South Wales, who along with her son cannot be named for legal reasons, had launched an action in the Supreme Court seeking damages over the scam. Reports said she was seeking an apology from the Commonwealth Bank, ANZ, Westpac and NAB for \\'\\'unconscionable conduct\\'\\' after allegedly allowing her son to open numerous bank accounts with debit cards \"without reasonable scrutiny\". She claims the banks ignored her or refused to discuss the matter for privacy reasons when she warned them they had issued accounts that were being used by a minor to bank illegal funds, reports said. \\'\\'He was an intelligent boy who worked out how to cheat the system and play it for all it was worth,\\'\\' she told Australia\\'s Sun Herald newspaper. \\'\\'As his parent and legal guardian, I begged the banks to stop giving him accounts and debit cards but each time I got nowhere because of the Privacy Act.\\'\\' She said her suspicions were aroused four years ago when her son began spending lavishly. She told the Sun-Herald she later uncovered a log book listing thousands of dollars worth of transactions with eBay. The boy, now 19, allegedly deceived the Commonwealth Bank into opening an account after fronting up to the bank with a birth certificate and a friend over the age of 18 who claimed to be his guardian, according to reports in Australian media. \\'\\'Once he secured that, he was able to accumulate check and Visa debit accounts with many other financial institutions including Westpac, the Bank of Queensland, ANZ, Credit Union Australia and the Hume Building Society,\\'\\' the mother was quoted as saying in the Sun-Herald report. Police eventually arrested the boy at school after many of the frauds were linked to an IP address attached to a classroom computer. By the time of his arrest, the boy was already allegedly working another scam, milking the $1,500 overdraft facility on a series of debit accounts. In the meantime, reports said, the boy lived a playboy lifestyle with shopping sprees for Versace and Prada clothes and Louis Vuitton luggage. \\'\\'There I was, a single mum of two, desperately struggling to put food on the table. He, meanwhile, would stroll in after feasting at the latest fancy restaurant of his choice and chuck me leftovers in a plastic tub,\\'\\' she told the Sun-Herald. Underneath the exterior, her son was an \\'\\'insecure boy out to impress,\\'\\' she told the newspaper.

Many commercial waxes are petroleum-based, although you can use natural products like beeswax, carnauba wax, and vegetable wax. Decide what you need from your hair wax and find an appropriate product.  Many hair wax products leave behind a sticky, hard-to-remove residue. Many low-residue products, however, do not hold your hair in place as well as the stickier products. Look for a wax with a good balance of hair-molding capability and low-residue depositing.  You can find hair wax in pharmacies, salons, and anywhere that sells hair-care products. You can usually order these products online. Make sure to compare prices and read the reviews before you make your purchase. Consider using a \"natural\" wax. Carnauba wax is extracted from the leaves of the carnauba palm tree, and beeswax taken from the hives of honey bees. Japan wax—also known as vegetable wax—is extracted from the berries of a type of sumac bush. In contrast, waxes derived from petroleum are called \"mineral waxes\" or \"cerosin waxes\", and they tend to be colorless and odorless. If you try to dress yourself after spreading wax through your hair, you risk rubbing your hair against a shirt or dress and ruining your hairstyle. Furthermore, you might rub wax off onto your clothing. If you must dress yourself after applying the wax, be exceedingly careful not to brush your hair against anything. .

              " '– Erin Brockovich is calling it the worst environmental catastrophe since the 2010 BP oil spill: Methane has been leaking from a well in Los Angeles for at least two months and will continue to do so for at least two more. Southern California Gas detected the leak—seen here using an infrared camera—at its underground natural-gas storage facility in the Porter Ranch neighborhood on Oct. 23, but it took officials until Sunday to identify the leaking well, per Quartz. As for exactly where the leak itself is in the 8,700-foot-deep well, the company is \"not sure,\" a rep tells the Los Angeles Times. Officials\\' solution: They\\'ve been drilling a relief well, which has hit a depth of 3,800 feet. CBS News reports they\\'ll go another 5,000 feet or so, intersect the leaking well, and plug it. They expect the drilling to be done Feb. 24. Several families are now suing SoCal Gas, per CBS News; 2,200 families have been relocated; and the county has fielded \"a substantial number of reports\" from people complaining of headaches and nausea. Popular Mechanics notes the FAA has gone so far as to keep flights out of the area. And then there\\'s the environmental toll: The Environmental Defense Fund says the leak has the same daily impact as do the emissions from 7 million cars—LA County has 6.2 million.

              " 'By FILIPE CAMPANTE and DAVID YANAGIZAWA-DROTT\\n\\nWE are in the Islamic holy month of Ramadan. During this time, as prescribed by one of the five “pillars,” or obligations, that make up the foundation of Muslim life, hundreds of millions of followers are abstaining from eating and drinking (and a host of other activities, like smoking and sex) between dawn and sunset.\\n\\nThis fasting does not burden all the world’s Muslims equally. For Muslims who live in the Northern Hemisphere, the day is longer at this time of year than it is in the Southern Hemisphere — which leads to longer fasts.\\n\\nBut this isn’t always the case. The Islamic calendar is lunar (around 354 days) and does not incorporate leap years, so Ramadan rotates slowly through the Western calendar, year after year, 11 days at a time. In a decade and a half, Ramadan will fall during the shorter days of winter in the Northern Hemisphere, while Muslims in southern locales like Australia and South Africa will face longer fasts.\\n\\nThis cyclical feature of Ramadan turns out to be a handy tool for social scientists. As we demonstrate in a working paper for the National Bureau of Economic Research, it helps us address a longstanding question: Does religion — specifically, the practice of religious rituals — affect economic growth?\\n\\nIt may seem obvious that engaging in religious practices (attending services, praying, studying sacred texts) would slow economic activity, as such activities take time and effort that could be directed elsewhere. Indeed, several recent empirical studies have found a negative correlation between such religious behavior and economic growth.\\n\\nBut correlation is not causation. The causal effect of religious practices on economic activity is much more difficult to establish, not least because there are so many other variables that influence economic activity. How can we tell what specific impact religious practices might have on economic growth? We need to somehow isolate that effect.\\n\\nThis is where the Ramadan cycle is helpful. Because the length of fasting during the holy month varies idiosyncratically but predictably as a function of the lunar calendar and latitude (factors that are presumably unrelated to those that affect economic behavior), Ramadan presents a kind of naturally occurring experiment: Religious practice is precisely varied and everything else is left in place.\\n\\nAnalyzing data taken from many countries over many years, we found that a more intense Ramadan (i.e., one with longer fasts) did indeed have a negative effect on growth in predominantly Muslim countries. This finding was robust, holding when growth was measured by gross domestic product; by G.D.P. per capita; in yearly rates; and when aggregated in up to five-year periods. We also found no effect of a more intense Ramadan on G.D.P. growth in non-Muslim countries, which increased our confidence in the finding.\\n\\nAccording to our numbers, if the average daily Ramadan fasting were to increase to 13 hours from 12, economic growth would decrease by about 0.7 of a percentage point.\\n\\nOur evidence indicates that the negative economic effect of Ramadan goes well beyond the short-term fall in productivity that you would expect from the fasting itself. Instead, it seems that a more intense Ramadan leads Muslims to choose to work less or, more precisely, to work in more flexible, if less productive, activities. At the same time, and quite possibly related, Muslims report to care less about work and money, and more about religion.\\n\\nOn the other hand, using data from the World Values Survey, a global research project focusing on people’s beliefs, we also found a striking effect of Ramadan on Muslims’ self-reported well-being. Following a particularly intense Ramadan, Muslims were more likely to state that they were happy and satisfied with their lives. This may have been a result of the spiritual practice itself, or of the socializing that Ramadan entails, or of a changed perspective on what is important in life — or of a combination of these and other possibilities.\\n\\nMore broadly, what this specific example of Ramadan shows is that religious practices can change people’s economic behavior in ways that are difficult to summarize as “good” or “bad” — even leaving aside the many other possible benefits and costs that our study was not designed to address.\\n\\nStill, and at the risk of being a tad simplistic, we are tempted to conclude that this year’s long days of fasting may make Muslims poorer than they would have otherwise been, but happier nonetheless.',\n",

(Associated Press) \\n  \\n North Korea\\'s new leader addressed his nation and the world for the first time Sunday, vowing before cheering troops and bouquet-waving citizens to place top priority on his impoverished nation\\'s military, which promptly unveiled a new long-range missile. \\n  \\n The speech was a highlight of two weeks of celebrations marking the centenary of the birth of his grandfather, national founder Kim Il Sung _ festivities that were marred by a failed launch Friday of a rocket that generated international condemnation and cost North Korea a food aid-for-nuclear freeze deal with Washington. \\n  \\n Kim Jong Un\\'s speech took North Koreans gathered at Kim Il Sung Square and around televisions across the country by surprise. His father, late leader Kim Jong Il, addressed the public only once in his lifetime. \\n  \\n Appearing calm and measured as he read the 20-minute speech, Kim Jong Un covered a wide range of topics, from foreign policy to the economy. His speech, and a military parade that followed, capped the carefully choreographed festivities commemorating Kim Il Sung\\'s birthday. \\n  \\n It was the best look yet the outside world has had of the young Kim, who is believed to be in his late twenties. \\n  \\n Punctuating Kim\\'s message that the North will continue to pour funds into its military, the parade culminated with the unveiling of a new long-range missile, though it\\'s not clear how powerful or significant the addition to the North Korean arsenal is. Some analysts suggested it might have been a dummy designed to dupe outside observers. \\n  \\n Although the rocket launch Friday was a huge, costly embarrassment for the new leadership, Kim\\'s address was seen by analysts as an expression of confidence by the young leader and meant to show that he is firmly in control. \\n  \\n \"Superiority in military technology is no longer monopolized by imperialists, and the era of enemies using atomic bombs to threaten and blackmail us is forever over,\" Kim said. \\n  \\n His message suggested no significant changes in national policy _ the \"Military First\" strategy has long been at the center of North Korea\\'s decision-making process. \\n  \\n But there was strong symbolism in the images of the new leader addressing the country on state TV and then watching _ and often laughing and gesturing in relaxed conversation with senior officials _ as the cream of his nation\\'s 1.2 million-strong military marched by. \\n  \\n Outside analysts have raised worries about how Kim, who has been seen but not publicly heard since taking over after his father\\'s December death, would govern a country that has a nuclear weapons program and has previously threatened Seoul and Washington with war. \\n  \\n At the celebration of Kim Il Sung, he appeared to clear his first hurdle. \\n  \\n The speech was a good \"first impression for his people and for the world,\" said Hajime Izumi, a North Korea expert at Japan\\'s Shizuoka University. \"He demonstrated that he can speak in public fairly well, and at this stage that in itself _ more than what he actually said _ is important. I think we might be seeing him speak in public more often, and show a different style than his father.\" \\n  \\n Kim said he will strengthen North Korea\\'s defenses by placing the country\\'s \"first, second and third\" priorities on military might. But he said he is open to working with foreign countries that do not have hostile policies toward his nation, and said he would strive to reunify Korea. \\n  \\n He also stressed the importance of national unity, calling his country \"Kim Il Sung\\'s Korea\" rather than North Korea. \\n  \\n \"That suggests to me that they want to let the country, and the world, know that this is a \\'new\\' country,\" said Han S. Park, a University of Georgia professor who works frequently with top U.S. and North Korean officials, after watching the events in Pyongyang. \\n  \\n The young leader said he will aggressively pursue economic growth to improve people\\'s daily lives. North Korea has suffered decades of economic hardship following a famine in the mid-1990s and the loss of aid from the Soviet Union. Kim Jong Un\\'s formal three-year succession has coincided with a push to improve the economy by employing modern technology. \\n  \\n Kim made no direct mention of the rocket failure. But North Korea\\'s state media made an extraordinary announcement hours after the launch, saying that the attempt to send a satellite into space had flopped. It still claims past launches succeeded, which international experts deny. \\n  \\n Concerns remain high that North Korea may now feel itself under pressure to make up for the botched rocket launch with a nuclear test _ as it did in 2006 and 2009. \\n  \\n The finale in Sunday\\'s military parade added to the worries over North Korea\\'s military. But analysts in Japan and South Korea said further examination is needed to determine whether it\\'s a new intercontinental ballistic missile that North Korea reportedly has been building. \\n  \\n Narushige Michishita, a North Korea military expert at Japan\\'s National Graduate Institute for Policy Studies, said the missile appeared to be new, but strongly resembled the rocket used on Friday and also the long-range Taepodong-2, which North Korea first launched, unsuccessfully, in 2006. \\n  \\n He said it probably has three stages but did not appear to be big enough to have the 15,000-kilometer (9,000-mile) range needed to effectively attack the United States, which would be the goal of an ICBM for the North. \\n  \\n \"I don\\'t think this is a serious ICBM,\" Michishita said. \"Putting it on display has a psychological impact, and that would have been greater if Friday\\'s launch had worked. But North Korea has a very bad record with long-range missiles. It think this is more a propaganda ploy than a military advance.\" \\n  \\n ___ \\n  \\n Associated Press writers Sam Kim, Foster Klug and Eric Talmadge in Seoul, South Korea, contributed to this report. |||||',\n",

Taiwan resident Lee Chun-hung took these pictures showing a ball of fire trailing across the sky. The 4,500 pages cover sightings that were reported from 1986 through 1992. The British military released them to a curious public as part of a four-year project to transfer all such documents to the National Archives. One highlight from the batch released Monday involves the captain of an Italian airliner. He shouted \"Look out!\" to his co-pilot in April 1991 after claiming to see a beige \"missile-shaped object\" shoot past the cockpit. In that instance, the defence ministry ruled out a missile and \"all the usual explanations,\" wrote David Clarke, a UFO expert and journalism instructor at Sheffield Hallam University, who worked with the National Archives to prepare the new materials for release. \"The end result was this was a genuine UFO and the file was simply closed,\" he wrote. \"There was nothing more they could do.\" The newly released documents also carry an account by a U.S. Air Force pilot who says he was told to shoot down an unidentified flying craft over eastern England. But before he could fire, the object disappeared. The next day, a man arrived to debrief the pilot and \"he was told in no uncertain terms that what he had seen on his radar was top secret and he wasn\\'t to speak about it to anyone,\" Clarke wrote. The first set of files was made available to members of the public in May. It covered reported UFO sightings from 1978 to 1987, and included hundreds of police reports taken from witnesses who described seeing lights or strange objects in the sky. People who reported having seen UFOs typically describe various shapes and colors of lights, moving in formation or hovering in the sky. Witnesses reported orange, red, white and green lights that were diamond-shaped, square, or cigar-shaped. They reported them to police, who have a standard 16-question form specifically for UFO sightings. \"The vast majority of them are just ordinary people who\\'ve seen something unusual and thought that they ought to tell someone about it,\" Clarke has said. The Ministry of Defence said it examined the reports solely to determine whether enemy aircraft had infiltrated British airspace. Once it was determined that no enemy aircraft were in the sky, it did not investigate further. \"The Ministry of Defence has no other interest or role regarding UFO matters and does not consider questions regarding the existence or otherwise of extraterrestrial life-forms,\" it said in May. That left many incidents unexplained.',\n",

The mother of a toddler who rolled onto a drug addict’s needle in a park is facing an agonising wait to see if her daughter has caught HIV. Two-year-old Siann Parkinson was doing barrel rolls down a grassy slope when she landed on the discarded hypodermic syringe. The needle pierced Siann’s right thigh, causing the youngster to scream out. By the time mum Annabel, 25, turned round, Siann had pulled the syringe out and was holding it with blood splattered on her trousers. Anxious wait: Annabel Parkinson will have to wait for up to two months to learn if her daughter Siann has contracted HIV. Horrified Miss Parkinson, a hairdresser, rushed the youngster to hospital and Siann was given a Hepatitis B injection and blood tests. They now face a distressing two-month wait until Siann can have more blood tests and injections to see if she has caught HIV from the needle. The incident happened on a grassy embankment by the cricket pavilion in King’s Park, Bournemouth, Dorset. Miss Parkinson said: 'One moment Siann was playing happily, throwing a ball for Jessie, our Staffordshire terrier dog, and rolling down the embankment in the park and the next we were rushing to hospital. Scene: King's Park in Bournemouth, where Siann Parkinson rolled onto the needle. 'She shouted out and I could see the needle in her hand, I thought she had picked it up but then I noticed blood on her right thigh and realised she had pulled it out of her leg. 'When I looked closer I could see that she had stabbed herself and also been scratched by the needle, I was horrified. 'We were seen within five minutes in hospital. 'Siann had a Hepatitis B injection and a blood test but we were told we would have to come back in June and July to have more injections and blood tests.

              " 'The German title \"Der totale Rausch\" (which literally translates as \"Total Rush\") by Norman Ohler is a play on words using the Nazis\\' references to \"total war,\" most famously made in 1943 by Josef Goebbels in a Berlin speech. As part of a series of questions, answered by the crowd with a chorus of \"ja,\" Goebbels said Britain believed that the Germans were ready to surrender, before asking \"wollt ihr den totalen Krieg?\" or \"do you want total war?\" \\n  \\n Ohler has spent recent years researching the Nazi leadership\\'s own appetite for a total rush, for themselves and their soldiers. He told DW that \"drug abuse in Nazi Germany was quite shocking.\" \\n  \\n DW: Total Rush - or Blitzed, which is the book\\'s English title - what gave you the idea for the book? \\n  \\n Norman Ohler: A Berlin underground DJ, a good friend of mine, once told me that the Nazis took loads of drugs. I\\'d never heard about that before. But it struck a chord; I felt it rang true, got curious and started going to the German federal archives and US national archives in Washington, D.C., and Maryland. \\n  \\n The first thing I wanted to see were the personal notes of Hitler\\'s personal physician Dr Theodor Morell - and to my delight these notes were quite elaborate, describing how he treated Hitler over the years, including things like \"injection as always\" and \"Eukodal,\" which is a strong opiate. \\n  \\n Was that the same drug the soldiers were given? \\n  \\n No, the soldiers used Pervitin, a German product patented in 1937 that contains methamphetamine, which is known today as crystal meth. \\n  \\n A keen look at drug-taking in the Third Reich \\n  \\n It was freely available as a medicine until 1939. In Berlin, it became a drug of choice, like people drink coffee to boost their energy. People took loads of Pervitin, across the board. The company wanted Pervitin to rival Coca Cola. So people took it, it worked and they were euphoric - a mood that matched the general mood before the war. \\n  \\n Then the army discovered Pervitin? \\n  \\n The army realized there is a drug out there that might be of interest to soldiers because Pervitin keeps you awake for a long time… for the first couple of days, you don\\'t need to sleep. It was used for the first time when Germany invaded Sudetenland and then Poland, and then when Germany attacked France in 1940, a Blitzkrieg strategy. Before that attack, the German army ordered 35 million tablets of Pervitin for the soldiers advancing on France. \\n  \\n Pervitin was used heavily in the German army. Hitler didn\\'t use Pervitin; he was into steroids - animal hormones got injected into his bloodstream. And later he used Eukodal, a pharmaceutical cousin of heroin. Hitler loved Eukodal. Especially in the fall of 1944, when the military situation was quite bad, he used this strong drug that made him euphoric even when reality wasn\\'t looking euphoric at all. The generals kept telling him: \"We need to change our tactics. We need to end this. We are going to lose the war.\" And he didn\\'t want to hear it. He had Dr. Morell give him the drugs that made him feel invulnerable and on top of the situation. \\n  \\n Hitler enjoyed pharmacological stimulants, Norman Ohler says \\n  \\n Was this common knowledge in Germany? \\n  \\n No one knew what Morell gave Hitler. Morell didn\\'t tell anyone and Hitler for sure didn\\'t. But a lot of people suspected there was something weird going on. There were some attempts to make Morell uncover what he gave Hitler, but he refused. It was a secret between those two men. \\n  \\n But the soldiers openly took Pervitin? \\n  \\n That soldiers were taking Pervitin was not a secret at all. In the beginning, the army didn\\'t realize Pervitin was a drug; they thought it was just like drinking coffee. But in 1941, it was outlawed and declared an illegal drug. In the army, distribution was then kept under wraps, but the records of the war against Russia aren\\'t as clear as those from the war against France, where we can see how many tablets were distributed. I spoke to a medical officer, who was in Stalingrad, and he said he still issued Pervitin in Stalingrad, but it didn\\'t basically make a difference. \\n  \\n Did other armies take such stimulant drugs as well? \\n  \\n They found out about the German drugs eventually, and the British used amphetamines. Basically, the Germans used crystal meth and the Brits used speed. Many of the American soldiers who joined the war effort went through Britain to get to the war theater and received amphetamines in Britain. The Americans took the drug to keep up with these crazed German soldiers. It took root in the American military: if you look at the Korean War in 1950, it was an amphetamine war where all the pilots were doped up. The Germans started with drugs in the military, but other countries followed suit. \\n  \\n LSD, for instance, was invented by a Swiss chemist, and American intelligence tried to use it, also based on German experiments in the Dachau concentration camp, where a doctor by the name of Plötner used mescaline to develop new interrogation techniques. When Americans liberated the concentration camp, they took these studies and used them in Project Artichoke and applied them in the 1950s to discover who was a Soviet agent and who wasn\\'t. \\n  \\n What came as the biggest surprise to you during your many years of research for this book? \\n  \\n I found Hitler\\'s excessive drug abuse to be the most astonishing. \\n  \\n Norman Ohler, born in 1970, is an award-winning German journalist and writer of novels and film scripts. He spent five years researching his first nonfiction book. He delved into archives in Germany and the US, and he spoke to eyewitnesses, military historians and doctors. \"Der totale Rausch\" hit the stores in Germany in September 2015, and was released in English under the title \"Blitzed - Drugs in Nazi Germany\" in October 2016. ||||| In Der Totale Rausch – (Total Rush), which was published in Germany last week, Norman Ohler reveals the key strategic role of the methamphetamine-based drug, manufactured from 1937 onwards by the Nazis under the brand name of “Pervitin” and distributed among the armed forces. \\n  \\n The drug was marketed as a pick-up pill which was designed to combat stress and tiredness and created feelings of euphoria. “In the beginning the army didn’t realise Pervitin was a drug: soldiers thought it was just like drinking coffee,” explained Mr Ohler. \\n  \\n But the Nazi leadership was well aware of Pervitin’s value as stimulant during combat. After having tried it in 1939 during the German invasion of Poland, the German army subsequently ordered 35 million tablets of Pervitin for soldiers before advancing on France in the spring of 1940. \\n  \\n The invasion of France shocked the world. In four days, Hitler’s tanks captured more French territory than German troops had managed to secure in four years of the First World War. Pervitin helped the invading Nazis stay awake, keep going and, apparently, feel great. \\n  \\n Mr Ohler bases his findings on months of research at military archives in Germany and the United States. Historians say his revelations will change current perceptions of Germany’s wartime military role; “The fact that the Blitzkrieg was a war fuelled by drugs, once again debunks the theory that the German army was clean,” said German historian Hans Mommsen. General Erwin Rommel is said to have consumed Pervitin as if it was his ‘daily bread’ \\n  \\n The Second World War General Erwin Rommel, the so-called “Desert Fox” is said to have consumed Pervitin as if it was his “daily bread”. He was decorated by Hitler as a tank commander during the invasion of France. \\n  \\n Mr Ohler explains how the Nazis rejected recreational drugs such as cocaine, opium and morphine which were readily available in Germany during the 1930s and condemned them as “Jewish”. The Third Reich’s chemists were encouraged to find an alternative stimulant more suited to an Aryan Master Race. The Nazi chemist Fritz Hauschild came up with Pervitin. \\n  \\n “The Nazis wanted Pervitin to rival Coca Cola, so people took it, it worked and they were euphoric,” Mr Ohler explains. To ensure that millions of German housewives on the home front were not left out, the Nazis even developed chocolates containing the drug. \\n  \\n The book also provides insights into the role of Hitler’s personal physician, Dr Theodor Morell. The author reveals that Morell managed to conceal the fact that he was Jewish by joining the Nazi party before the war and obtaining new identity papers. \\n  \\n Morell is said to have made Hitler completely dependent on drugs, turning him into a virtual junkie by the time he committed suicide in his Berlin bunker in 1945. Mr Ohler gained access to Morell’s notes which reveal that he gave Hitler a total of 800 injections over a period of 1,349 days. \\n  \\n But more telling are Ohler’s revelations about Hitler’s growing dependence on a drug called “Eukodal” – a pain killing narcotic with double the strength of conventional morphine. He discloses that Hitler was first given the drug before a meeting with Mussolini in 1943 at a point when Italy was considering backing out of its alliance with Nazi Germany. \\n  \\n After two Eukodal injections, the Nazi leader felt so good that he was able to convince Mussolini to stay with Germany for the time being. |||||',\n",
              " '– At 3:12am today, Michigan state Rep. Todd Courser resigned from his seat in the legislature, though it appears he had no intention of doing so when he entered the room 14 hours earlier. The move came after two failed votes to expel Courser, 43, as well as a lengthy debate about his affair with Rep. Cindy Gamrat, 42, who was expelled shortly after Courser gave his resignation, reports the Detroit Free Press. The affair came to light after Courser sent an anonymous, phony email to GOP activists in May claiming he was a \"bi-sexual porn-addicted sex deviant\" who paid for sex with men, per the AP. The email was apparently intended to make Courser\\'s affair with Gamrat seem less egregious or even unbelievable if it became known. Courser says he and his brother had received texts from someone who threatened to expose the affair. Both Courser and Gamrat admitted to misconduct and misuse of taxpayer resources but hoped they would only be censured. A special committee had voted 4-0 to expel the pair, but the first vote in the House failed 67-14 as many Democrats chose not to vote; a second vote also failed. Only when an amendment calling for police and AG investigations into the controversy were added to Gamrat\\'s expulsion resolution did it pass 91-12 around 4am. \"I just felt like it was the appropriate moment to do it,\" Courser says of his resignation. \"Whether it was the third vote or the fourth vote or the fifth vote, they were going to eventually get me.\" A magistrate has issued a search warrant ordering AT&T to give up information about the prepaid phone used in the apparent blackmail scheme.',\n",

Police have confirmed that a decomposing body found in a field near a freeway in west Houston is Adriana Coronado, 14. She had been shot multiple times. A neighbor tells the Houston Chronicle that she and her gardener found the body, which had been dragged into bushes, because of the smell. Adriana, who was last seen at around 1am last Saturday, was still wearing pyjamas and slippers, says the neighbor, who is disturbed that the girl\\'s body was \"thrown out there like trash.\" The burned body of Adriana\\'s father, Caesar Coronado, was found in a ditch last week.

The sport suspended Kurt Busch indefinitely yesterday over allegations that he beat and choked his then-girlfriend last fall, reports ESPN.

The judge cited Busch\\'s \"propensity to lose control of his behavior and act out violently in response to stressful, disappointing and/or frustrating situations involving his racing,\" reports the News Journal.

The post-Code editing (read: destroying) of this film warrants a 2-point demerit.\\n\\nFrom my very limited knowledge of film history, Baby Face was apparently one of two movies that finally broke the camel\\'s back and brought the full wrath and enforcement of the Production Code into play in 1934. (I don\\'t know what the other movie was.) As a result, the movie in its original incarnation was never allowed to be re-released after 1934. It was chopped and edited to bits, and no original version is known to exist today. The best that we can see today is the version that TCM (Turner Classic Movies) shows, but that is blatantly edited in several scenes, and has a really disappointing \"happy ending\" slapped onto the end.\\n\\nAll the above being said, the movie is still pretty darned great and lots of fun to watch. Barbara Stanwyck is, as always, absolutely amazing and wonderful. She is so beautiful and powerful; she just owns the whole movie! She plays a woman who\\'s been used by men her entire life, starting with her father who pimps her out to the local Erie, PA steel workers as well as to local politicians in a quid pro quo of \\'if you don\\'t shut down my speakeasy I\\'ll let you sleep with my daughter\\'. When the father dies in a fiery explosion near the beginning of the flick, the smile on Stanwyck\\'s face is priceless.\\n\\nAfter the fire, Stanwyck leaves Erie with her maid and heads to New York City. She sets her sights on a skyscraper and starts literally working her way to the top. Starting out with the personnel clerk in the HR department, she sleeps with him to get an entry level position at the bank. From there, she sleeps with man after man after man (including a very young John Wayne) using each new man to help her land a higher paying job on a higher floor of the skyscraper, with increasingly powerful male bosses cum sugar daddies. Stanwyck stops at nothing in her rise to the top. It is great fun to see her and her maid in increasingly fancier clothes and apartments as Stanwyck works her way up the corporate ladder. Stanwyck is the ultimate femme fatale, manipulating, she-vixen in this flick! If you watch this movie, I recommend stopping when you see the George Brent character (Courtland Trenholm) die in Stanwyck\\'s arms. Skip the remaining 3 minutes or so! The \"happy ending\" slapped on to the end of the movie for post-Code audiences is insulting to the audience\\'s intelligence and lame beyond belief: the bank board members are sitting around a table expositing about Mr. and Mrs. Trenholm\\'s million dollar donation to the bank and how they are living happily but poor in Erie, with former VP Trenholm now working in the steel mills - cut to the exact same footage of a steel plant that we saw in the beginning of the movie - \"The End\". PUH-LEEZE - HOW LAME! The movie originally ended with George Brent succeeding in his suicide attempt. I think that ending fits the overall mood of the movie much better than the slapped on post-Code ending.\\n\\nI certainly hope that a print of the original pre-Code version of this flick is discovered during my lifetime (update: the original HAS been found and should be out on DVD and/or TCM in 2006!). Until then, I\\'ll enjoy the TCM version and switch it off before the lame-o post-Code ending.',\n",
              " 'A good soldier never publicly contradicts the commander in chief, at least not intentionally, and Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel is a good soldier. A Vietnam War veteran, Hagel provided a robust defense of President Barack Obama\\'s approach to ISIS jihadists in Iraq and Syria when interviewed Wednesday by CNN National Security Correspondent Jim Sciutto. With Obama facing criticism over what even a fellow Democrat called too much caution, Hagel sought to make clear that the President wants to eliminate any ISIS threat to the United States and its interests -- both abroad and at home. \\'Degrade and destroy\\' \"We\\'re providing the President with those options to degrade and destroy\" the ability of the group that calls itself the Islamic State to attack Americans anywhere in the world, he said. When Sciutto pressed for clarity on Obama\\'s statement earlier Wednesday , asking if the President meant containment, Hagel sough to clarify what his boss said. Asked whether Obama meant \"containment\" when he said earlier Wednesday that the goal was to manage the ISIS threat, Hagel said, \"No, it\\'s not contain.\" \"It\\'s exactly what the President said: Degrade and destroy.\" Why it took Obama so long to address his no ISIS strategy comments. And so it went for an hour of questions from Sciutto and some in the audience at the Naval War College in Newport, Rhode Island. Hagel repeatedly expressed agreement with Obama\\'s positions on Syria and Ukraine, where the international community has said Russian troops have crossed the border to help pro-Russian separatists fighting the Ukrainian military. Asked if Obama tipped his hand by rejecting a U.S. ground invasion against ISIS three years after bringing home combat forces from Iraq, Hagel said, \"We\\'re not going to go back into Iraq the same way we came out of Iraq a few years ago.\" Biden\\'s warning to ISIS: \\'We will follow them to the gates of hell\\' Instead, he advocated Obama\\'s broad-based strategy that calls for a new and more inclusive Iraqi government, an international coalition supporting it and limited U.S. military action like the airstrikes launched last month at ISIS targets in the north. \"There\\'s no question in my mind\" that the Obama administration approached the ISIS issue with a \"sense of urgency,\" Hagel said, adding that possible airstrikes on the jihadists\\' positions in Syria were among the options the Pentagon has presented to the President for further steps. What can the U.S. do against ISIS in Syria -- and could it work? On the Ukraine conflict, Hagel sounded a similar theme. If Russian President Vladimir Putin continued to escalate the fighting there, he would face further consequences on top of U.S. and European Union sanctions imposed so far, but \"we\\'re not going to get into a military engagement, a war, over this with Russia,\" Hagel said. \\'Sick to your stomach\\' The ISIS issue dominated the hour-long interview. Hagel said the videotaped beheadings of two American journalists by the Sunni jihadists \"makes you sick to your stomach, but it again reminds you of the brutality and barbarism that is afoot in some places in the world.\" \"It won\\'t just recede into the gray recesses of history until we stop it,\" he said. At one point, Hagel misspoke about the number of Americans believed fighting with ISIS. \"As we have acknowledged publicly, we are aware of over 100 U.S. citizens who have U.S. passports who are fighting in the Middle East with ISIL forces,\" he said, referring to the group by another acronym for the Sunni jihadists used by some U.S. officials. \"There may be more -- we don\\'t know.\" The Pentagon later told Sciutto that Hagel\\'s figure referred to the total number of Americans believed fighting in Syria with various groups, not just ISIS.

Condemned British drug smuggler Lindsay Sandiford could be executed within weeks after Indonesia signalled its intention to resume state executions. No one has been put to death in the country since 2008, and because of this at least 12 death row inmates believed they had avoided execution. However, attorney general Basrief Arief has announced that death sentences will be carried out again soon. Sources in the Indonesian province of Bali, where Mrs Sandiford, 56, is being held after being sentenced last month, have suggested her crime has led to the decision to resume executions. She was caught smuggling £1.6million worth of cocaine through Bali airport last year. Mrs Sandiford has to lodge an appeal by February 12 but is having difficulty in paying for a lawyer to handle the process. If the deadline is missed she must then rely on presidential mercy. If the current 12 death row inmates are executed, they will be the first to die since November 2008 when three terrorists convicted of the 2002 Bali nightclub bombings were tied to posts in an orchard and killed by a firing squad. That year, 10 people were executed, compared to a total of 11 in the previous decade. Although Mr Basrief has said earlier that the respite in executions since 2008 had been due to long appeals processes, which he wanted shortened, he is also said to have been dismayed at the brazenness of drug smugglers in recent years.

Here we enter into the mystery of the human being.\" He also addressed criticism that he hasn\\'t gotten all that political, seeing as he doesn\\'t talk much about gay marriage, birth control, or abortion. But the church\\'s teachings on all of the above are already clear, he said, and \"it is not necessary to talk about these issues all the time.\" Further: \"The church\\'s pastoral ministry cannot be obsessed with the transmission of a disjointed multitude of doctrines to be imposed insistently. We have to find a new balance; otherwise even the moral edifice of the church is likely to fall like a house of cards, losing the freshness and fragrance of the Gospel.\" CNN notes that none of the pope\\'s comments broke with Catholic doctrine, but did signal a shift to a more accepting approach; Francis himself said he wants to change the church\\'s \"attitude,\" since it sometimes gets \"locked ... up in small things, in small-minded rules.\" He continued, \"The people of God want pastors, not clergy acting like bureaucrats or government officials.\" Sorry, though, no female priests: Francis was quite clear that the \"door is closed\" on women being ordained.

              " 'By. Liz Jones. PUBLISHED:. 16:30 EST, 4 August 2013. |. UPDATED:. 16:30 EST, 4 August 2013. The Holy Grail of fashion is how to dress the bigger, older woman without making her feel patronised, ripped off or marginalised. Many have tried. Clothing tags at plus-size shop Evans show if the style will suit an apple or pear shape, and the brand hired trendy design duo Clements Ribeiro to create a collection, where the designers broke all the ‘big girl rules’ by using patterns, stripes and showing bare\\xa0flesh. Marks & Spencer is also making an attempt with its new lines for bigger women, which use a more accurate mannequin, better fabrics, and seams, darts and waistbands. Into the fray comes Marisota, the online retailer, which caters for the plus-size and over-35 woman who loves fashion. Black & gold brocade jacket, £79, lace top, £40, maroon jeans, £40, gold snakeskin shoes, £35. And of all the brands, I would wager it has done its homework. So, could this be the label to change the way larger women shop for ever? I went to view its autumn/winter range at its lab in Manchester, where Marisota employs ten buyers, five fabric technologists and six ‘shapeologists’. I met one such shapeologist, Hannah Pemberton, who says her role is about being a ‘creative planner’. If, like me, you don’t know\\xa0what that means, she can enlighten us: ‘It’s my job to empathise and understand what goes on in a woman’s head — how she thinks and feels about her looks and body, and how confident she is.’ She does this by listening to women. And she has listened to a lot — 1,500 of them from size 12 (which is where Marisota starts) to a size 32, aged 40 to 70. So what did Marisota find out? A whopping 77 per cent want to hide their stomachs. Nearly half struggle to find clothes that suit their shape. More than 79 per cent want to hide their flaws, while 81 per cent want to enhance their best bits (I can’t think why this wasn’t 100 per cent for both). Most of them get style help from their daughters, a huge number avoid social outings because they have nothing to wear, and most are repelled by negative language in advertising — words such as ‘repair’ and ‘fix’. Finally, the brand found that as we get older we are less obsessed with size and more interested in our shape. Floral dress with inbuilt Spanx, £65, gold snakeskin shoes, as before. Leopard print coat, £130, lace top, as before, black tuxedo trousers, £35, court shoes, as before. Marisota has used fabric technology to ensure every garment has some sort of hidden panelling and support, as well as clever colour blocking (think Stella McCartney’s famous trompe l’oeil red carpet dress; it’s no surprise to discover a consultant on the brand is stylist Cheryl Konteh, who dresses Kate Winslet) to give its wearer a waist. Best of all, it has a bespoke service, so if you happen to be top heavy, say, you can have a dress adjusted to suit. All this, plus wide-fit boots and shoes, and lingerie with bras that go up to an L — the biggest cup size available in the UK. But what of the new, cutting-edge autumn/ winter collection? It is all monochrome, which apparently is what bigger women want. There are sleeves, lace panels, and secret support for tummies and buttocks, even in a very floaty floral dress, at just £50. There is a great pencil skirt with a patterned panel that really does slim the hips, at £35, and a bodycon illusion dress, £45. Red coat, £49, Aztec panel skirt, £35,. white lace top, £40, heels, £30. There is a lovely pink pea coat, £55, that I prefer to the more tweedy coats, which I imagine big women will think makes them look even chunkier. Similarly, a poncho-style sweater would, I think, make a larger women feel like a house. Shirts, at £25 to £35, cleverly don’t gape at the bust, and the sleeves are neither too narrow nor too voluminous. Fabrics aren’t\\xa0 natural or top notch, but you do need Lycra or Elastane to hold bits and bobs in, so I will let them off. My only gripe, but it’s a big one, is that the campaign has been shot on a size 12 model. The brand managers say this is what shoppers want, but do we, really? The model in the promotional video is thin. So we put some pieces on a model who is a size 16, and I think they look even better. Bodycon dress, £45, snakeskin handbag, £60, heels as before. Grey check and dogstooth dress, £65, court shoes, £35, envelope clutch, £25. I like the stretchy tuxedo trousers — they have a\\xa0 stripe that’s slimming, as is the high waist — and the metallic jacket, though I’d have added vents to give it a kick. On the whole, though, shapes are a bit boxy, which meant we added bulldog clips at the back to ‘nip’, and the sleeves a little too wide. My best buy is the faux Stella McCartney tote with chains, £55. I’m assured the festive collection will be more fun, without making us look like Christmas trees. Let’s hope they have the courage, having seen our photo shoot, to use a model who is truly representative. As one size 20 fan of the brand told me when I showed her the new looks: ‘We need proper chunky.’ Styling: ELIZA SCARBOROUGH Pictures: L+R Hair and make-up: CLAIRE RAY Fashion assistant: ANTONIA MAGOR Model: GINA at MILK.',\n",

Featuring  masonry columns, painted gold features, two galleries, wrought iron balustrading and a glass-domed lantern roof, a wing of the South Australian State Library has been listed among the top-20 most beautiful libraries in the world. The Mortlock Wing opened in 1884 in Adelaide CBD, and still features original furniture and a large Dent and Son clock over its main hall. The wing joins the likes of Oxford University's Bodleian library in England, the Marciana Library in Venice, Italy, the Bibliotheca Alexandrina in Egypt, America's Library of Congress in Washington, D.C. and the Royal Library in Copenhagen, Denmark, in the list compiled by Travel and Leisure website. The Mortlock Wing of the South Australian State Library has been named in a list of the top 20 most beautiful libraries in the world. 'Old World': An employee said the library had a Harry Potter-esque magic feel to it. Jo Chesher has worked at the South Australian State Library for more than 10 years and said she still gets goosebumps when walking into the wing. She said the wing's clock is wound by staff each week and has an 'audible tick', which excites visiting school kids. 'It also seems to be getting a reputation of being rather Harry Potter-esque, with an Old World and a bit of a magic feel to it,' she told AAP.

Books at the library date back to colony times and can still be inspected. The wing opened in 1884 and is located within the library in Adelaide CBD. Considered one of the most beautiful parts of a library in the world, the wing took 18 years to build. Taking 18 years to build, the wing first opened as a public library, museum and art Gallery with 23,000 books and three staff. The length building process was due to political indecision and delays, design changes and issues relating to the building being over an underground stream, which caused the foundations unstable, reported State Library of South Australia. Original features of the wing include two gas 'sunburner' lamps in the office space on the second floor and some remaining wallpaper in a room off the ground floor. While students are able to study at grand heavy timber desks, visitors from across the globe are greeted by one of the library's 30 volunteer ambassadors. The Bibliotheca Alexandrina, in Alexandria, Egypt also made the list of the world's most beautiful libraries. Denmark's Royal Library Copenhagen was one of the more contemporary libraries to be featured thanks to its modern features. Marciana Library, located in St Mark's Square in Venice, Italy features ornate detailing both inside and out. 'Visitors are gobsmacked - after first going through a very modern, glass, light and timber walkway they then literally take a step back in time.' Among the selection of old books are half-a-dozen which came to Australia in trunks during colony times and can be taken out of shelves and inspected. Some of the first-floor balcony-level books are from the early 1900s and were originally circulated to people in country South Australia. The South Australian State Library was the only in Australia to make the list, piping out the NSW State Library and Victoria State Library.

              " 'Choose the side you want to swing from, then face the ball. If you are right-handed, stand on the left side of the ball. Point your left shoulder towards the target. If you are left-handed, stand to the right of the ball with your right shoulder pointed towards the target.  The half of your body closest to the target is your front side, such as your front arm and leg. Is This half is most important for aiming and driving the ball forward. The half furthest from the target is your back or rear side. This half is responsible for your backswing and generating power. Walk backwards from the ball if you are unsure where to stand. When hitting the ball, you will need to bend over slightly. If this feels uncomfortable, you can move closer or further from the ball as needed. You should be able to see the top of the ball without standing over it.  If your head is directly over the ball, you will have a hard time generating a smooth, powerful swing. If you stand too far away from the ball, you will have to stretch your arms further to hit the ball, weakening your drive. Stand beside the ball, spacing your legs about a shoulder width apart. The ball should be positioned a little behind the inside part of the heel on your front leg. This means the ball will be much closer to your front leg than your back leg.  A wider stance means you will swing the driver in a wider arc. This can throw off your timing, so keep your feet relatively close together at first. Focus on getting your stance correct before bringing the club into position. Once you have mastered this, you can do both simultaneously to improve your aim.. This grip is called the overlap grip and is beginner-friendly. Position your back hand on the driver’s grip. Then, place your front hand above it, resting 1 or 2 fingers over your lower hand. Adjust your grip until it feels comfortable and balanced, neither tight nor loose.  An interlocking grip is when you cross your index finger and pinkie. This is a good grip for fast swings and anyone with smaller hands. A 10-finger grip is like holding a baseball bat. Your fingers do not overlap. It can be good if you lack strength, but it leads to less powerful drives. Plant your feet firmly on the ground so they stay in position. Slowly bend forward, keeping your back and neck straight. Your head should come forward so you are able to look diagonally down to your club’s head and the top of the ball.  Your back and neck should be flat. If your spine is bent at all, you may tire out and get sore while playing. The ball should line up with your front ear, although your ear will be behind the ball instead of over it. Twist forward and towards your front leg. Bring the club around so it is near the tee. This should cause your front hip and shoulder to raise up. You want your front side to be slightly higher than your back side. To get yourself in position, you may shift your weight to your back leg. If you are having trouble getting the angle correct, take your back hand off the club. Put it behind your rear knee to lower your shoulder, then put it back on the driver grip again. Position the club head so it is centered behind the ball. Let your shoulders hang down, then pull them back slightly. This should make your arms feel firm, ready to control a steady swing. If you feel like you can’t swing the club freely, adjust your positioning as needed by stepping back or standing straighter.  This position causes the head of the driver to strike the ball on the upswing, lifting it off the tee. Balance is key. Make sure your weight is evenly distributed in both legs.',\n",

              " '\\nOne thing became abundantly clear during the past several days of inauguration festivities in Washington, D.C.: Joe Biden is running for president in 2016. \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n Joe Biden and Dr. Jill Biden at Monday night\\'s inaugural ball/ AP photo \\n  \\n Ok, Biden isn\\'t technically in the race. (Technically, there isn\\'t a race yet either.) And, of course, minds can change between now and 2016. But, Biden is doing everything that someone who is planning to run would do. Everything. \\n  \\n \"In a couple years he is going to take a hard look at it,\" acknowledged Delaware Attorney General Beau Biden of his father\\'s interest in running for president during an interview on MSNBC this morning. But, Biden appears to already be taking that \"hard look.\" \\n  \\n Consider the following: \\n  \\n * Biden -- with Beau, a major rising star in both Delaware and nationally, in tow -- not only stopped by the Iowa State Society\\'s inaugural ball on Saturday night but also delivered this gem of a line: \"I am proud to be president of the United States, but I am prouder to be Barack -- I mean, excuse me.\" (He quickly corrected himself to note he was/is proud to be President Obama\\'s vice president.) As we have said before, no politician goes to Iowa -- or to the Iowa State Society inaugural ball -- by accident. It just doesn\\'t happen. \\n  \\n * Biden invited New Hampshire Gov. Maggie Hassan to attend his private swearing-in for a second term on Sunday at the vice presidential residence. New Hampshire, as you might remember, plays a pretty important role in the presidential primary process. \\n  \\n * Biden was in full Biden mode during the inaugural parade on Monday, working the crowd in a way that had \"Vote for Me!\" written all over it. If you missed Biden\\'s performance -- there is no other word for it -- you can watch six minutes of Joe being Joe below. \\n  \\n Politicians very rarely do things by accident and you can bet someone who has been in the game for as long as Joe Biden knows exactly what he is doing. And what is that? Ensuring that any other politician looking at the race -- or any donor or activist beginning to mull who they should support -- knows that the contest runs through Biden. That is, the Martin O\\'Malleys and Andrew Cuomos of the world will have to make their decisions about the race knowing that the sitting Democratic vice president is very much interested in running and likely to be in the field. \\n  \\n We\\'ve written recently in this space that Biden, so often caricatured as a gaffe-spitting, oafish figure, is more formidable than many people realize. Biden\\'s work in averting the fiscal cliff coupled with his leadership role in the White House\\'s push on tightening gun laws has, at least for the moment, changed perception about the vice president as a candidate for the top office. \\n  \\n As Roll Call political columnist Stu Rothenberg wrote in a must-read piece handicapping the 2016 race today: \"For different reasons, [Hillary] Clinton, now the outgoing secretary of State, and Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. are in a tier all their own, though they aren’t in an identical place within that tier.\" \\n  \\n Stu\\'s right. There\\'s no question that everyone -- up to and including Biden -- will have to wait to see what Clinton decides since she would be a clear favorite if she gets into the 2016 contest. \\n  \\n But, if Clinton says no, Biden may have the next best claim to frontrunner status. And, what the past few days have convinced us of is that if Clinton doesn\\'t run, Biden almost certainly will. ||||| It is far too early to handicap the 2016 Academy Awards, the 2016 World Series or the 2016 Summer Olympics. And yet, if you are a true political junkie, you may already be apoplectic that we aren’t yet knee-deep in discussions about the next presidential race. \\n  \\n While you have my pity if you are one of those people, it’s undeniably true that politicians being who and what they are, it is never too early to ponder about the next step of the political ladder. And for some, the White House is the only rung that really matters. \\n  \\n I remember in 2005 asking Robert Gibbs, then the press secretary for recently elected Sen. Barack Obama of Illinois, whether, given the talk of a Draft Obama campaign, the freshman senator was mulling a presidential run in 2008. \\n  \\n Gibbs, whom I had known from his days at the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, laughed at the absurdity of the question (I thought it silly, too, but wanted to make sure that I wasn’t missing something) and assured me that no, the just-elected senator had no intention of running, no matter what rumors or draft movements were floating around the Internet. \\n  \\n Obama understood where he ranked in the pecking order and was only starting to learn how things were done on Capitol Hill, Gibbs assured me, adding the obvious disclaimer that, of course, nobody knows what will happen down the road, but the freshman senator wasn’t considering anything as soon as 2008. \\n  \\n It wasn’t terribly long after that that Obama did start to look at a possible bid for the Democratic nomination, no matter how intimidating the probable candidacy of then-Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York looked. \\n  \\n I don’t believe, I should point out, that Gibbs had intentionally misled me. I believe that the freshman senator wasn’t seriously thinking about a presidential run when I asked. \\n  \\n But things can change quickly in Washington, D.C., and Democrats started whispering into the ear of the then-senator from Illinois that while 2008 wasn’t an ideal time for him to mount a presidential bid, it might turn out to be the best time. Who knows when another opportunity for a fresh face and political outsider will come along? \\n  \\n Open seats are difficult to resist, since they often seem enticingly winnable. That should make 2016 a tempting prize for presidential hopefuls on both sides of the aisle. \\n  \\n The Democratic side looks too easy to handicap, which probably means surprises are in store. \\n  \\n For different reasons, Clinton, now the outgoing secretary of State, and Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. are in a tier all their own, though they aren’t in an identical place within that tier. \\n  \\n For many, Clinton, who started as the solid favorite for the Democratic nomination only to have Obama snatch it from her, is the prohibitive favorite for her party’s nomination if she wants it. At this point, we just don’t know if she will want it. Maybe the former first lady doesn’t even know yet. \\n  \\n Biden, who will turn 71 toward the end of this year, was mocked often during Obama’s first term, but the former Delaware senator’s role in negotiating a deal to avert the fiscal cliff and his lead role in trying to come up with gun legislation that could be both effective and enacted suddenly makes him look like a more serious contender in 2016, if he chooses to run. \\n  \\n After Clinton and Biden, the list becomes more speculative. New York Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo and Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley are seen as ambitious and interested. Former Montana Gov. Brian Schweitzer probably should be on the list as well. \\n  \\n Cuomo’s oratorical skills and access to New York state’s Democratic dollars can’t be ignored, and while O’Malley didn’t exactly set the world on fire at the 2012 Democratic National Convention, his state has put up good numbers on education and his very liberal views could be appealing to Democrats. Schweitzer has a folksy quality that many like, though I have felt for years that he tries way too hard. \\n  \\n If Clinton takes a pass, another woman or two could well come forward (New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand has received mention, but other names are sure to circulate, as well), and given the makeup of the Democratic Party, a serious minority contender certainly can’t be ruled out. \\n  \\n Compared with the early Democratic line, the list of possible GOP hopefuls looks about the size of the cast of “Les Misérables.” \\n  \\n Unsuccessful vice presidential nominee Rep. Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal surely have to be at or near the top of any list. \\n  \\n New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, who resisted efforts to draft him into last year’s race, sounds more likely to run in 2016, though he probably hurt himself more with rank-and-file Republicans with his comments praising Obama after Superstorm Sandy than most national political reporters now understand. \\n  \\n Former Sen. Rick Santorum, who ended up being the final anti-Mitt Romney alternative in the race for the 2012 GOP nomination, is acting as if he will be a candidate, and Texas Gov. Rick Perry has indicated that his seriously flawed run last year wouldn’t preclude him from making another try. (Perry, of course, has not announced whether he will seek re-election in 2014.) \\n  \\n Two high-profile governors over the past couple of years, Wisconsin’s Scott Walker and Virginia’s Bob McDonnell, probably should be on any list. McDonnell leaves office at the end of this year, so he will need a way to remain relevant after that. One senator who need not worry about that is Kentucky’s Rand Paul, who is widely seen as a future presidential contender, possibly as early as 2016. \\n  \\n Paul is heir to a movement led by his father, former Rep. Ron Paul of Texas, though the senator seems to want to broaden his appeal and work within the GOP rather than rely primarily on libertarians (and Libertarians). \\n  \\n Depending on what happens in 2014, a number of other Republican governors could also look at a run, possibly Michigan’s Rick Snyder or Ohio’s John R. Kasich, who has run for the White House before. \\n  \\n And the preliminary list obviously lacks any women, so New Mexico Gov. Susana Martinez and New Hampshire Sen. Kelly Ayotte (and possibly even South Carolina Gov. Nikki R. Haley, if she wins re-election next year) are likely to receive mention, though right now the GOP lacks a woman who is ready to be a top-tier presidential contender. \\n  \\n Of course, over the next two years, many politicians’ stocks will rise or fall, so some names on the lists will drop off and some not receiving mention now surely will be added. Obama can testify to how quickly things can change. \\n  \\n Stuart Rothenberg (@stupolitics) is editor of the Rothenberg Political Report (rothenbergpoliticalreport.com). ||||| 4 years ago \\n  \\n Washington (CNN) - Vice President Joe Biden met with Democratic Party delegates Tuesday afternoon, the latest move he\\'s made over the past few days that could be considered an early signal that the vice president may be laying the groundwork for a possible 2016 run for the White House. \\n  \\n The vice president greeted Democratic National Committee delegates at the Omni Shoreham hotel in the nation\\'s capital, where they were gathered for the DNC\\'s annual winter meeting. \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n Follow @politicalticker \\n  \\n Tuesday\\'s outreach to influential Democratic leaders and activists from across the country follows a weekend of hints that Biden may be gearing up for what would be his third bid for the White House. \\n  \\n Saturday night the vice president stopped by the Iowa State Society\\'s inaugural ball in Washington, and Sunday Maggie Hassan, New Hampshire\\'s Democratic governor, attended Biden\\'s swearing-in ceremony at the Naval Observatory, which serves as the vice president\\'s residence. Top state party officials from Iowa also were in attendance. Iowa\\'s caucuses and New Hampshire\\'s primary just so happen to lead off the presidential primary and caucus calendar. \\n  \\n And Monday the vice president proved again why he is a masterful politician when it comes to connecting with people, working the crowd as he walked along stretches of the inaugural parade from the Capitol to the White House. \\n  \\n Biden used his Tuesday meeting behind closed door with party delegates and leadership to thank everyone for their support in last year\\'s election, according to a Democratic source who was in the room. The vice president also thanked outgoing DNC officers for their efforts, and welcomed the incoming party officials. He also spoke about his outreach efforts in the states. \\n  \\n While the vice president didn\\'t mention any future bid for the Democratic nomination during his comments to the delegates, the source said it was clear that Biden was hinting towards 2016. \\n  \\n Biden, who served nearly four decades as a senator from Delaware, unsuccessfully ran for the Democratic nomination in 1988 and 2008, before becoming President Barack Obama\\'s vice president. On Election Day 2012, when asked if it was the last time he\\'d vote for himself, the vice president said \"No, I don\\'t think so.\" \\n  \\n When asked last week in an interview with CNN Chief Political Analyst Gloria Borger if there were any reasons why he wouldn\\'t run in 2016, Biden said \"there\\'s a whole lot of reasons why I wouldn\\'t run. Um, I haven\\'t made that decision. And I don\\'t have to make that decision for a while.\" \\n  \\n Mission number one for Biden right now is to help President Barack Obama pass his agenda. A successful second term for Obama will only help any Biden bid for president. \\n  \\n \"Everything that should be done over the next two years that I should be part of would have to be done whether I run or I don\\'t run. If this administration is successful, whoever is running as a Democrat is better positioned to win,\" Biden told Borger. \\n  \\n Outgoing Iowa Democratic Party chairwoman Sue Dvorsky, who saw Biden Saturday night at her state\\'s inaugural ball and who attended Biden\\'s Sunday swearing-in ceremony, says \"I imagine we might see quite a bit of him again.\" \\n  \\n \"Joe Biden remembers and cares about every single activist he\\'s ever worked with. He\\'s been in Iowa since 1987,\" adds Dvorsky. \"When he looks out at a crowd, I\\'ve watched him, he can identify, \\'Hey Patty,how\\'s the grand daughter.\\' And then he names the grand daughter\\'s college. And he\\'s right, every time.\" \\n  \\n One person who may stand in Biden\\'s way if he chooses to run is outgoing Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. \\n  \\n According to a CNN/ORC International poll conducted last month 85% of Democrats and independents who lean towards the Democratic Party said they\\'d be very or somewhat likely to support Clinton if she makes another bid for the Democratic nomination, with two-thirds of Democrats questioned saying they would be very or somewhat likely to support the vice president if he runs for the White House. Other possible 2016 candidates asked in the survey trailed Biden by at least 10 points. \\n  \\n Clinton is expected to step down as secretary of state later this month, with the Senate expected to confirm Sen. John Kerry of Massachusetts as her successor. \\n  \\n Clinton has repeatedly said that she intends to retire to private life and she\\'s added that another run for the White House is not in the cards for her. \\n  \\n \"Look, I\\'m flattered. I am honored,\" she told CNN\\'s Wolf Blitzer last year about calls by other Democrats for her to consider another run in 2016. \"That is not in the future for me, but obviously I\\'m hoping that I\\'ll get to cast my vote for a woman running for president of our country.\" \\n  \\n The 2012 presidential election is barely in the rear view mirror, but in some ways the next race for the White House is already beginning. \\n  \\n - CNN Political Reporter Peter Hamby contributed to this report |||||',\n",
              " '– Democrats in Iowa last weekend officially ditched the name of their annual Jefferson-Jackson Dinner, a move that\\'s part of a larger trend taking place around the country, reports CNN. While the party has long celebrated Thomas Jefferson and Andrew Jackson at such dinners, the pair\\'s own slave-owning history is finally taking a toll. Jackson\\'s role in driving Native Americans out of the southeastern US—the \"Trail of Tears\"—also is a factor.

              " \"When you read the summary of this film, you might come to think that this is something of an odd film and in some ways it is, for the primary character of this film, Gerard Reve (Jeroen Krabbé) is haunted by visions and hallucinations. The visions Gerard see are all (more or less) subtle hints to what will happen to him as the story continues and it is great fun for the viewer to try and figure out the symbolism used in the film. Despite the use of symbolism and a couple of hints to the ending of the film, the film maintains a very high level of excitement throughout and does not get boring for one minute. This is mostly due to the great performances of Jeroen Krabbé and Renée Soutendijk (Christine) and the great direction of the whole by Paul Verhoeven. His directing style is clearly visible and one can say, looking at it from different angles, that 'De Vierde Man' is a typical Verhoeven film. It will not only seem typical for people familiar with his American films because of the nudity and the graphic violent scenes, but it will also seem typical for people familiar with his Dutch films, because of the same things and his talent to tell a great story. When people watch Verhoevens American films, short sighted people might say, he has no talent in telling a good story and only focuses on blood and sex. That is what some people think, whereas I think that he is a very talented director who tries to convey a deeper message in each with each film. Although not a good film, Hollow Man (his last American film) is an example that Verhoeven can do more than science fiction splatter movies and maybe companies should trust him more and offer him more various films to helm. He needs that. Just watch his Dutch films. Not only do they show that he needs a certain amount of freedom, but they also show that he has remarkable talent. 'De Vierde Man' brought him one step closer to Hollywood and is certainly one of his best.\\n\\n8 out of 10\",\n",
              " \"\\nGordon Derrick, the mustachioed general secretary of Antigua and Barbuda’s tiny soccer federation, glanced around at the faces of the FIFA delegates as they tucked into a hotel lunch buffet.\\n\\nDerrick has been part of this close-knit circle of officials, who represent some of the smallest soccer federations in the western hemisphere, for more than a decade. But for all that familiarity, there was one thing he didn’t know about these men and women: which candidates they planned to vote for in Friday’s presidential election.\\n\\n“From our point of view,” he said, “the candidates are all saying what we want to hear.”\\n\\nThe delegates from the Confederation of North and Central America and the Caribbean are unlikely kingmakers. For many years this was an obscure corner of world soccer. Then, last May, it was gutted—and nearly bankrupted—by corruption allegations brought by the U.S. Department of Justice. Its past three presidents have since been indicted and the organization is still conducting its own expansive probe.\\n\\nNow, less than a year later, Concacaf has emerged as the decisive region in the most consequential presidential election in FIFA’s history. With 35 members, including the U.S., Canada and more than 20 Caribbean nations, it represents 17% of the FIFA electorate. And while other confederations under the FIFA umbrella have formed blocs to support one candidate, Concacaf hasn’t issued any instructions to its members on how to vote Friday.\\n\\n“I think the role of a confederation is to serve its members, not to impose on its members,” the Canadian federation president Victor Montagliani said. He added that members would be free to caucus and vote as a bloc if they wanted to, “but that hasn't happened.”\\n\\nThe five presidential candidates were well aware of this Thursday as they shuttled around Zurich in black cars, dropping in to lobby the confederations again. In their final pitches to Concacaf, they returned to the tried and trusted FIFA playbook pioneered by former president Sepp Blatter, which consists chiefly of offering more money and resources. The two front-runners, Asian confederation president Sheikh Salman bin Ebrahim al-Khalifa of Bahrain, and European confederation No. 2 Gianni Infantino of Switzerland, both dangled promises of financial assistance, committee posts and World Cup spots in an effort to woo voters.\\n\\nIn his 10-minute speech, Infantino reiterated a plan to funnel $5 million over the next four years to each member association for soccer development. “We can do it easily just by looking at the cost structure of FIFA,” he said.\\n\\nSheikh Salman, meanwhile, chose to highlight an existing “Memorandum of Understanding” between Concacaf and his own Asian confederation, designed to promote the sharing of best practices and resources. “I hope that we can make it effective,” he said.\\n\\nHe also pledged to create plenty of committee roles to keep member associations close to the FIFA mothership—even as FIFA reformers hope to reduce the bloated number of standing committees from 26 to 9. “It’s important that the majority of associations have input into FIFA’s operations,” Derrick said. (He also argued that the perks that come with FIFA travel weren't as lavish as they seem. “It took me 24 hours to get here. I don’t know how glamorous that is,” he said).\\n\\nOne topic that isn’t being discussed among the Concacaf members, Derrick said, are the allegations of Sheikh Salman’s role in the Bahraini royal family’s crackdown on pro-democracy protests in 2011. “I’ve heard the claims and I’ve heard the counter-claims. I haven’t done any in-depth research.”\\n\\nFriday’s election will poll 207 of the 209 FIFA member associations—Kuwait and Indonesia are likely to remain suspended, which would rule them out from voting. A candidate needs to secure two-thirds of the vote (138) to win on the first ballot. Anything less and FIFA’s voters will be called again, one by one, to vote for a second time. At that point, and in any subsequent rounds, a simple majority will suffice. Several voters said they expected the election to be settled in two rounds.\\n\\nOne prominent Concacaf member nation ended the suspense Thursday. A post on the Twitter TWTR 1.76 % account of U.S. Soccer Federation president Sunil Gulati said the U.S. would be voting for Jordan’s Prince Ali al Hussein. A handful of Concacaf members have declared support for Infantino.\\n\\nBefore delegates vote on a president, they will vote on a set of measures which, reformers say, will determine the long-term health of the organization. The proposals include more roles for women in the upper echelons of FIFA, greater financial transparency, term limits for FIFA’s senior executives, more independent operational oversight, and reducing the number of standing committees. FIFA regulations require 75% of the Congress to approve them.\\n\\nActing FIFA president Issa Hayatou and the interim secretary-general Markus Kattner visited each confederation Thursday, imploring them to pass the reforms. Concacaf has already agreed to vote unanimously in favor of them. “This is our opportunity to show the world that we can build a stronger FIFA,” Hayatou said, using language lifted directly from the “FIFA Messaging Toolkit” memo that the organization sent to its candidates last week.\\n\\nDerrick said he had little doubt that the reforms would pass. He also hinted that he’d made up his mind on the election, too: He just couldn’t be sure whether anyone else was heading in the same direction.\\n\\n“You think at the last hour we’re going to be swayed?” Derrick said. “Give us a little more credit.”\\n\\nWrite to Joshua Robinson at joshua.robinson@wsj.com\",\n",

              " 'The Syrian conflict has become \"increasingly militarized\" as killings and torture by regime security forces and anti-government fighters raged this spring, a United Nations panel reported Thursday. Meanwhile, the U.N. secretary-general said there is no fallback plan to deploying monitors to some of the Middle Eastern nation\\'s most embattled cities. U.N. monitors on the ground in five Syrian cities are making \"all possible efforts to stop violence\" and have had \"some dampening effect,\" Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon told CNN\\'s Christiane Amanpour. But he conceded, \"We were not able to completely cease the violence.\" In an interview on \"Amanpour,\" Ban said the full cadre of observers -- 300 -- authorized by the Security Council last month would be on site in the coming days. \"They are patrolling every day, whenever possible,\" he said. \"They try their best to cease this violence. It requires strong political will at the level of President Assad, and also it requires full cooperation by the opposition forces.\" The report by the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Syria noted the growing power of forces opposed to President Bashar al-Assad. \"Whereas government forces had previously been responding primarily to demonstrations, they now face armed and well-organized fighters -- bolstered by defectors who joined them.\" \"Gross violations continue unabated,\" the commission\\'s report said, adding regime forces commit most of the \"serious human rights violations.\" The documented abuses \"reflect this shifting context\" amid widespread fears that the popular uprising against the regime of al-Assad, spurred by a tough crackdown against peaceful protests, is spiraling toward all-out civil war. Violence has raged daily. At least 40 civilians were killed across the country Thursday, the opposition Local Coordination Committees of Syria said, among them \"a complete family ... martyred in the shelling\" of a neighborhood in Hama. Another opposition group, the Syrian Observatory of Human Rights, reported 43 people killed. Its toll includes 35 civilians mostly in the provinces of Homs, Hama and Idlib, as well as eight government forces dead in clashes with defectors in Damascus, Deir Ezzor, Homs and Idlib. U.N. officials say more than 9,000 people, mostly civilians, have died and tens of thousands have been uprooted since the uprising began in March 2011. Opposition groups report a higher death toll in excess of 11,000 people. The commission said abuses have mounted since March, even though al-Assad\\'s government and opposition forces say they have embraced U.N. and Arab League envoy Kofi Annan\\'s six-point peace plan that includes a cease-fire. The military has conducted \"large-scale\" strikes on sites known for \"hosting defectors and/or armed persons\" escorting protests or supporting the Free Syrian Army, the anti-government resistance force, the report said. People have died when security forces shelled \"small opposition strongholds,\" conducted house-to-house searches and placed snipers on rooftops. Lethal force has been used against protesters in Idlib, Homs, Aleppo, Hama, Damascus, Daraa and villages nationwide. \"Many such protests were accompanied by armed groups, which have described their role as providing protection for the demonstrators,\" the report said. \"The resulting clashes were deadly for demonstrators, members of these armed groups and security forces alike, yet too often citizens bore the brunt of the violence.\" Torture and arbitrary arrest remain a problem, the report\\'s authors said, citing the case of a man accused of trafficking for anti-government groups as an example. \"They allegedly beat him severely and applied electric shocks to his legs,\" the report said. Children have been killed or injured in attacks on protests and by snipers\\' gunfire, while government forces have targeted schools and used one as a command post. Boys as young as age 10 detained by regime forces \"repeatedly indicate that they are tortured to admit that older male members of their family are \\'Free Syrian Army\\' soldiers or supporters,\" the report said. \"Wounded children have been unable to seek treatment due to fears of being perceived as anti-government armed groups supporters or for fear of being beaten in health facilities. Children have died due to a lack of health care during government blockades. Some, including those injured as a result of torture, have been willfully denied medical care.\" Anti-government armed groups have executed security forces and suspected collaborators, the report said. One military defector cited the execution of three Iranian snipers, and there have been reports of \"makeshift prisons.\" \"One anti-government armed group fighter also admitted that he and his associates had killed government soldiers when the captives refused to join them,\" the report said. The groups also have increased their use of homemade bombs known as improvised explosive devices. Some people interviewed described bombs made of \"nails inside pipes with explosive powder and a fuse,\" and others made of gas and fertilizer. One fighter described planting mines that targeted army tanks. There have been reports of security forces or their supporters confessing under torture after their capture by resistance fighters. \"Two Iranians, held in late January 2012 and released in late April 2012, later made public statements about physical abuse suffered, including the breaking of bones, during their captivity,\" the report said. There have been instances of fighters kidnapping security forces and civilians, purportedly for prisoner exchanges but also for use as ransoms to buy weapons. Some anti-government groups have used children \"as medical porters, messengers and cooks, for units in the field and delivery of medical supplies to field hospitals.\" The report pointed to bombing attacks in Damascus, Aleppo and Daraa between March and May, including the suicide car bombings in Damascus on May 10 that left 55 people dead. The commission said it can\\'t \"ascertain\" who is responsible for the \"criminal\" acts. Some experts and officials say neither security forces nor anti-government forces may be responsible, suggesting \"third\" forces -- such as jihadi groups -- may be to blame. Ban distanced himself from his earlier assertion that al Qaeda \"must be\" behind the Damascus bombings, saying Thursday, \"We do not have any clear evidence what al Qaeda was behind.\" Nonetheless, \"considering the scale and sophistication of the terrorist attacks,\" the U.N. leader said, \"it seems to be clear that there are certain organizations and groups with ... clear political intent.\" One senior Jordanian official told CNN that there are nearly 1,500 al Qaeda members and sympathizers in Syria. Many have entered the country from Iraq and Lebanon and have been part of a bombing and ambush campaign against Syrian intelligence and military targets. American officials are concerned about jihadists in Syria and work with border countries to thwart them. But some U.S. officials say the 1,500 number is too high. Ban said Thursday the growing tension in Lebanon, where clashes erupted earlier this week after the killing of two anti-Assad clerics, is very troubling. \"We are entering into a pivotal moment,\" Ban told Amanpour. \"We are very much worried about this kind of spillover effect. ... We have to prevent this.\" The report was issued as Syria\\'s newly elected parliament convened to elect a speaker and swear in new members. The government said the elections were all-inclusive, but opposition forces call the process a sham. The opposition Syrian National Council is looking for a new leader after the resignation of its Paris-based president, Burhan Ghalioun. Syria\\'s opposition has long been fractious, proving a disappointment to Western and Arab nations who dislike the regime and want al-Assad out of power.

Early in the jump, he started spinning out of control—a problem that also almost killed the last altitude and speed record-holder Joe Kittinger 50 years ago—but Baumgartner was able to stabilize when the air got thicker, and the rest of his jump went smoothly, including the landing in the New Mexico desert. \"At a certain RPM, there’s only one way for blood to leave your body, and that’s through your eyeballs,\" Baumgartner explained after the jump. \"That means you’re dead. That was what we feared most.\" \"Trust me, when you stand up there on top of the world, you become so humble,\" he continued. \"It’s not about breaking records anymore. It’s not about getting scientific data. It’s all about coming home.\" Kittinger himself guided Baumgartner from mission control, the New York Times notes. \"He demonstrated that a man could survive in an extremely high altitude escape situation,\" Kittinger said after the jump. \"Future astronauts will wear the spacesuit that Felix test-jumped today.\" The 4-minute, 20-second jump was also good news for social media, the AP reports—nearly 7.3 million viewers watched it live on YouTube; a picture of Baumgartner after landing was shared more than 29,000 times in less than 40 minutes on Facebook; and tweets about the jump surpassed even those about Justin Bieber.

The parents, brother and sister-in-law of accused killer Philip Markoff visited him in jail on Friday. Markoff\\'s parents, brother, and sister-in-law visited him Friday, having to get through a throng of media members who gathered near the Boston, Massachusetts, jail.

Police have said Brisman, a model, advertised as a masseuse on Craigslist, a popular online classifieds service. They say Markoff may have met her through the online site. Prosecutors say Brisman sustained blunt head trauma and said the she was shot three times at close range. One of the bullets passed through her heart, killing her, prosecutors said. Markoff is also charged in connection with the April 10 robbery of Trisha Leffler, 29, at a Westin Hotel in Boston, another woman he allegedly met on Craigslist. Leffler was robbed of $800 in cash and $250 in American Express gift cards, police reports said. Prosecutors said she was bound and held at gunpoint.

              " 'The July 20 shooting spree at a midnight screening of \"The Dark Knight Rises\" in Aurora, Colorado, seems ultimately to have had a relatively modest impact on the release of the superhero blockbuster, at least in terms of its box-office performance. But it has thrown a major wrench into Warner Bros.\\' plans for another film, the upcoming action-drama \"Gangster Squad.\" In the immediate wake of the shooting, the studio pulled the trailers for the film, which — in a grisly unintended echo of the Aurora tragedy — featured a scene of mobsters bursting through a movie screen and firing machine guns at people seated in a movie theater. Days later, the studio and director Ruben Fleischer (\"Zombieland\") decided to cut, or at least extensively rework, that scene. Given that the movie-theater-gangland-massacre sequence was a key plot point in the film — which stars Josh Brolin and Ryan Gosling as Los Angeles cops assigned to take down real-life 1940s mob kingpin Mickey Cohen (Sean Penn) — any changes to it inevitably would necessitate script revisions and reshoots, jeopardizing the film\\'s planned Sept. 7 release date. Now a source confirms that Warner Bros. is pulling the film off of the fall schedule. No new date has been determined yet, though according to the Hollywood Reporter, the studio is eyeing dates in January as a possibility. Warner Bros. declined to comment on the decision, but clearly moving the film will both allow the filmmakers the time required to make changes to the movie and give the studio an opportunity to reboot a marketing campaign that was derailed by horrible circumstances no one could have foreseen.

death emerged immediately after the official announcement of his hospitalisation on 28 August.\\nThe initial report by the cabinet gave no details of his illness.\\nOn 29 August, the president\\'s youngest daughter, Lola Karimova-Tillayeva, said on Instagram that her father had had a brain haemorrhage over the weekend and was in intensive care.\\nOn the same day, independent website Fergananews published its first report of Mr Karimov\\'s death.\\nThe Moscow-based news agency said his death occurred between 15:00 and 16:00 local time on 29 August.\\nThat was denied by unnamed sources at the presidential administration and sources close to Mr Karimov\\'s family.\\nBy the time the cabinet officially announced his death on the evening of 2 September, several foreign leaders, including the Turkish prime minister, had already expressed their condolences to the Uzbek people on the death of their leader.\\nA long and detailed medical report on \"Patient Islam Karimov\" was read out on state television on the evening of 2 September and published on the government portal, gov.uz, after the official announcement had been made.\\nSome analysts say it was done in an attempt to stop speculation, including suggestions of a possible coup within the president\\'s inner circle.\\nThe official medical report confirmed earlier reports about the nature of his illness and a foreign doctor\\'s participation in the treatment.\\nBut there were some inconsistencies in this official report too.\\nFor instance, the report said foreign specialists including Prof Alexander Potapov, the director of Russia\\'s NN Burdenko Neurosurgery Institute, who officials said had arrived in Tashkent on 28 August, fought for the president\\'s life until the very end on 2 September.\\nBut BBC Uzbek has confirmed that Prof Potapov was already back in his office at the NN Burdenko Institute in Moscow on 31 August.\\nAnother Russian specialist, Prof Leo Bokeria, whose name was mentioned in the official medical report, was in Moscow on 29 August.\\nProf Bokeria, who had reportedly treated the Uzbek leader before and was familiar with his history of illness, denied that he had travelled to Tashkent and refused to talk to journalists, including the BBC\\'s Russian Service.\\nAt the same time, Russia\\'s Deputy Prime Minister Olga Golodets said Russia had not received any official requests to treat the Uzbek president.\\nSome suggest that Uzbek officials who had never encountered such a situation before was unprepared and did not know how to deal with the president\\'s unexpected death.\\nAs one social media user commented: \"The Uzbek government cannot confirm President\\'s death because it had no instruction from the President himself.\"\\nOne former member of Mr Karimov\\'s administration has told the BBC that groups involved in a power struggle wanted to have a clear agreement over the possible successor before the president was officially declared dead.\\nUnder the Uzbek constitution, if the president dies or is unable to carry out his duties, power passes temporarily to the head of the Senate until an election can be held, which should be within three months.\\nUzbek officials have yet to formally announce the acting president or arrangements for presidential elections, if they are to be called.\\nBut the Kremlin stated that President Vladimir Putin had sent his condolences to the \"head of parliament\\'s upper house and acting President Nigmatilla Yuldoshev\".\\nMr Yuldoshev, a former justice minister who is regarded as an unlikely contender for permanent power, was not given a central role in the funeral and was not seen meeting foreign leaders arriving in Samarqand to pay their respects to the Karimov family.\\nPrime Minister Shavkat Mirziyoyev and his first deputy, Rustam Azimov, acted as pall-bearers and stood beside each other during the funeral ceremony.\\nBoth have long been rumoured as possible successors to Mr Karimov.\\nBut it was only Mr Mirziyoyev, who made a speech at the ceremony as chairman of the funeral commission, who was shown meeting Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev.\\nMr Mirziyoyev, 59, is the country\\'s longest-serving prime minister with a reputation of having \"a fist rather than a brain\".\\nHe has denied allegations of mistreating subordinates and beating them up, saying in 1998 that it was \"not his style to beat someone\".\\nHe is reported to have close links with Russian oligarchs and is in charge of the country\\'s key agricultural sector including the cotton industry, which has been criticised internationally for the use of child and forced labour.\\nHe worked closely with Mr Putin when the Russian leader was his country\\'s prime minister between 2007 and 2011.\\nAs Uzbekistan enters the post-Karimov era, many believe that real power lies in the hands of Rustam Inoyatov, head of the powerful SNB security service.\\nA leaked US diplomatic cable from 2008 described him as a \"key gatekeeper to President Karimov\" and his style as alternating between \"engaging and menacing\".\\nMr Inoyatov, 71, is regarded as the main instigator of moves to sideline Mr Karimov\\'s once-powerful daughter, Gulnara.\\nThere are fears that questions of the succession may contribute to uncertainty in the short term.\\nAnother key figure is the long-standing head of the presidential administration, Zelimkon Haydarov. He may play an influential role behind the scene.\\nThe Uzbek government has not made any significant statements on future foreign policy.\\nMr Karimov tried to sit between the regional interests of the big powers and resisted Moscow\\'s attempts to integrate Uzbekistan into its economic and security blocs.\\nMost of his colleagues from the former Soviet Union, including Mr Putin and Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev, failed to attend the funeral.

The protests were sparked by Trump calling for NFL owners to fire players who decline to stand for the anthem in a rally in Alabama on Friday. Some NFL players, coaches and executives Sunday stood arm-in-arm along the sideline. Some sat, knelt or raised a fist. The Pittsburgh Steelers didn\\'t even come on the field during the anthem. The Cowboys met multiple times over the last three days, sources said, to carefully consider their options. Plans began immediately after Saturday\\'s practice in Frisco and didn\\'t get finalized up until 15 minutes before kickoff. Ultimately, they chose the path of least resistance with millions of viewers tuned into their Monday Night Football game against Arizona. Cowboys players, coaches and executives came onto the field before the national anthem and stood arm-in-arm before taking a knee. Owner Jerry Jones; his sons, Stephen and Jerry Jr.; his daughter, Charlotte; and coach Jason Garrett were among those on the field. Jones and his family are usually in a suite during the anthem. After the Cowboys kneeled, fans at University of Phoenix Stadium booed. The Cowboys then went to the sideline as the U.S. flag was stretched across the field. The Cowboys and the Jones family again locked arms as Jordin Sparks sang the national anthem. \\n  \\n Vernon Bryant/Staff photographer Dallas Cowboys players and staff including owner Jerry Jones and head coach Jason Garrett all take a knee before the singing of the National Anthem prior to the start of a game against the Arizona Cardinals at University of Phoenix Stadium Monday, Sept. 25, 2017 in Glendale, Ariz.

It took a lot of conversation of how to do that. \\n  \\n The Cowboys\\' demonstration carries more weight because the franchise has been referred to as \"America\\'s Team\" the last 40 years. No franchise is more valuable or draws more ratings. \"Great show of unity,\" NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell tweeted. \\n  \\n Great show of unity.

Then-49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick sparked the movement in August 2016 as he sat on the bench during the national anthem to protest police brutality. \\n  \\n Very few NFL players publicly protested, however, before Trump created a firestorm Friday with criticism that players referred to as \"divisive.\" \"Wouldn\\'t you love to see one of these NFL owners, when somebody disrespects our flag, to say, \\'Get that son of a bitch off the field right now, out, he\\'s fired. He\\'s fired!\" Trump said Friday. \"You know, some owner is going to do that. He\\'s going to say, \\'That guy disrespects our flag, he\\'s fired.\\' And that owner, they don\\'t know it [but] they\\'ll be the most popular person in this country.\" Trump doubled-down on his criticism of NFL players with almost 20 tweets the last three days. \"The issue of kneeling has nothing to do with race,\" Trump tweeted Monday morning. \"It is about respect for our Country, Flag and National Anthem. NFL must respect this!\" \\n  \\n The issue of kneeling has nothing to do with race. It is about respect for our Country, Flag and National Anthem. NFL must respect this! — Donald J.

Garrett said Saturday he didn\\'t expect any players to protest. Garrett said he didn\\'t see any need to address Trump\\'s criticism with the team. \\n  \\n That changed the last few days, however, with Garrett gauging his players\\' emotions about Trump\\'s comments. \\n  \\n \"I\\'ve never been prouder of my association with players and a coaching staff as I am with this crew,\" Jones said. \"We all agreed that our players wanted to make a statement about unity and equality. They were very much aware that that statement when made or when attempted to be made in and a part of in recognition of our flag can not only lead to criticism but also controversy. It was real easy for everybody to see the message of unity and equality was getting pushed aside or diminished by controversy. We even had the circumstances that it was being made into a controversy.\" The Cowboys met at least three times to plan how they\\'d respond to Trump\\'s comments, sources said. The club\\'s leadership council, which includes more than a dozen prominent players, met Sunday night to discuss the possibilities before the entire team gathered to further talk over their options. The Jones family was also involved with the plans. \"It was a team thing,\" wide receiver Dez Bryant said. \"That\\'s the true definition of unity. Trump can\\'t divide this.\" The usually outspoken Jones fell silent after Trump created waves. The Cowboys were the only organization among the NFL\\'s 32 teams that hadn\\'t released a statement on Jones\\' behalf by Monday night. The Cowboys chose not to do so because Jones, unlike any other owner, always speaks to the media after games. Jones was one of at least nine NFL owners to donate to Trump\\'s inaugural committee. His $1 million donation came via Glenstone Limited Partnership, a group that shares an address with the Cowboys\\' Frisco team headquarters and has state filings that show direct connections to Jones. Before Monday\\'s game, the Cowboys and Cardinals were among only six NFL teams that had yet to have a player protest during the national anthem by either kneeling, sitting or raising his fist. The other four: the Bears, Bengals, Jets and Vikings. The Cardinals didn\\'t protest during the national anthem Monday but also stood arm-in-arm along the sideline. Jones was asked about his thoughts on Trump\\'s criticism. \"I made my mind up on this issue that I wasn\\'t going to comment,\" Jones said. \"I want actions to be louder than words. And we did it. We made our statement.\" Staff Writer David Moore contributed to this report. \\n  \\n The Dallas Cowboys took a knee before the anthem, but stood with locked arms during it.

(2:10) \\n  \\n GLENDALE, Ariz. -- The Dallas Cowboys and Arizona Cardinals displayed unity before their game Monday night in an expression of displeasure with comments made by President Donald Trump on Friday . \\n  \\n As the Cardinals were introduced, Cowboys owner and general manager Jerry Jones, and executive vice presidents Stephen Jones, Charlotte Anderson and Jerry Jones Jr., stood locked arm in arm with Dallas\\' players, coaches and staff. \\n  \\n Before a giant American flag was unfurled that covered almost the entire field, the Cowboys -- including Jerry Jones -- took a knee briefly as a group. This took place before the national anthem, and led to a smattering of boos from the crowd in Arizona that included a large number of Dallas fans. \\n  \\n But during the national anthem, the Cowboys stood locked arm in arm, and no one took a knee or appeared to show any sign of silent protest. \\n  \\n The Cardinals lined up along the goal line of the southern end zone as Jordin Sparks sang the national anthem behind them. Some players linked arms. Some put their hands on the shoulders of teammates. Defensive tackle Frostee Rucker and tight end Ifeanyi Momah kept their helmets on. \\n  \\n Among the players, coaches and staff who lined up was Cardinals president Michael Bidwill, who locked arms with wide receiver Larry Fitzgerald and cornerback Patrick Peterson. Fitzgerald locked arms with coach Bruce Arians on the other side. Bidwill\\'s sister, Nicole, and brother, Tim, as well as general manager Steve Keim were also standing with the players. \\n  \\n \"I made my mind up on this issue,\" Jerry Jones said after the Cowboys\\' 28-17 win, \"that I wasn\\'t going to comment other than I am very proud of the fact that the Dallas Cowboys and our players have always stood for the flag and the recognition for the flag always. What is important is to figure out that to show the kind of respect and the perception of respect. How can [the team] in front of a national audience show unity and a statement of equality. [The team] wanted to do that. It evolved throughout the organization, particularly over the last two days, and it was executed. \\n  \\n \"I can\\'t say enough about the understanding and the awareness of our team and these young men, if you will, that basically said, \\'You know, that makes sense.\\' There\\'s no need for us to talk about unity and equality and have 60 percent of this country mad at you because you\\'re not being perceived as honoring the flag. And this was a way to do both.\" \\n  \\n Trump tweeted his reaction to the Cowboys\\' actions Tuesday morning. \\n  \\n The booing at the NFL football game last night, when the entire Dallas team dropped to its knees, was loudest I have ever heard. Great anger — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 26, 2017 \\n  \\n But while Dallas dropped to its knees as a team, they all stood up for our National Anthem. Big progress being made-we all love our country! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 26, 2017 \\n  \\n Arians said the decision to lock arms before the anthem was a decision made by the players. \\n  \\n \"We had one meeting about it and it was their decision,\" Arians said. \\n  \\n Arians said he was moving forward from the demonstrations. \\n  \\n \"That\\'s all over with. I coach football. I\\'m not a politician,\" Arians said. \\n  \\n Every NFL team that took the field Sunday had some form of demonstration in response to Trump saying owners should fire the players who disrespect the flag by not standing during the national anthem. Hundreds of players, coaches, executives and owners stood together arm in arm, sat, knelt, raised a fist or stayed in the locker room during the national anthem. \\n  \\n Leading up to Monday\\'s game, there was much internal debate in the Cowboys and Cardinals organizations, and even between the two teams. \\n  \\n Peterson told ESPN\\'s Lisa Salters that when he woke up on Saturday morning and heard about Trump\\'s comments, he and another teammate went to Arians and asked if players could do something in response before Monday night\\'s game. \\n  \\n That started a series of conversations with the Cowboys -- including Fitzgerald reaching out to Dallas tight end Jason Witten -- to discuss a possible joint show of unity. Those conversations continued throughout the day Monday, but ultimately the decision was made that there would be no joint team response. \\n  \\n Witten said he had a smile on his face Monday night because he was proud to be a part of the Cowboys \"and the men that make this team what it is.\" \\n  \\n \"I am going to stand for the national anthem with my hand over my heart until the day I die,\" Witten said. \"I respect our country and the servicemen that represent our flag. One nation under God with liberty and justice for all. I believe in that. I also can respect and agree to disagree, and that is what the locker room is all about. There are a lot of different ways. That is what is special about this locker room, a lot of different opinions and a lot of different thoughts on it. \\n  \\n \"It\\'s important to take the high road and you show unity and you look to create a better good,\" Witten said. \"I think our team tried to do that tonight. I am proud of my teammates and our entire organization.\" \\n  \\n Peterson, asked after the game if he thinks the Cardinals will continue to stand together as a team during the anthem, said he wasn\\'t sure. \\n  \\n \"That we don\\'t know,\" Peterson said. \"That we don\\'t know.\" \\n  \\n Jerry Jones and his daughter, Charlotte, said Cowboys players wanted to take a knee as a statement for equality and unity, but also wanted to separate that message from the national anthem. \\n  \\n As Arians entered University of Phoenix Stadium on Monday, he wore a handwritten note of support around his neck that read, \"Love!! Not Hate!!\" \\n  \\n A little less than an hour before kickoff, Jerry Jones said he respected the players \"individually and collectively,\" but did not want to get into the political element of the debate. \\n  \\n The final decision on what the Cowboys would do in protest was finalized only 20 minutes before kickoff. \\n  \\n Jones was in the locker room with the players beforehand, but it\\'s not clear whether he addressed the team. \\n  \\n The Cowboys wanted to strike a balance between addressing the needs of the players who wanted to have some form of protest, while acknowledging those who wanted to stand for the anthem. \\n  \\n In the past, Jones has said he liked how the Cowboys handled the national anthem. Since the silent protests started a year ago -- with Colin Kaepernick drawing the most attention -- the entire Cowboys roster has stood in a row along the sideline. \\n  \\n Jones was one of seven NFL owners to donate to Trump\\'s inaugural committee. So far, the Cowboys have not released a statement on Jones\\' behalf regarding Trump\\'s recent stance, but the NFL, the NFL Players Association and a number of teams and executives issued statements calling Trump\\'s comments \"divisive.\" \\n  \\n \"We want them to do what\\'s in the best interest of the Dallas Cowboys,\" Jones said. \"That\\'s where the obligation is, and again I don\\'t want to get into this area of debate, but I do want to emphasize how important it is to me that we respect the sanctity of the flag.\" |||||',\n",

Lady of Shanghai is on the same level as his other masterpieces, The Magnificent Ambersons, Touch of Evil, The Trial, and Chimes at Midnight. The plot can tend to be confusing sometimes, and sometimes it seems to be moving maybe a tiny bit too fast (about an hour of it was edited out when test screenings went poorly). It doesn't matter, however. You can't watch Welles' films and manage to concentrate too much on the plot. His direction defines what great direction is. Almost any scene from this film can hold up with any other scene he directed. Check out the courtroom scene. Usually they are such stock scenes that I can't stand them. Case in point, try to sit through Welles' own speech near the end of Compulsion. In Lady from Shanghai, just pay attention to the level of detail in that courtroom scene. Watch that juror who is always sneezing and interrupting the proceedings. Or just take a look at the lighting in that scene. I know, it is just a simple Venetian blind, and that it was used constantly in film noirs and crime films of the era, but Welles gives it a beauty all its own. The dialogue is also remarkable. Welles had the skill, a skill that no one else seemed to have, to make a crime film containing examples of the grandest poetry. Whether he was speaking Shakespeare or spitting out hard-boiled lines, it had the power to stir the soul. 10/10.\",\n",

A former specialist police officer who worked for Scotland Yard's division in charge of protecting the Royal Family was arrested today by detectives probing corrupt payments to public officials. Police from Operation Elveden, which runs alongside the force's Weeting investigation into phone hacking, swooped on the 57-year-old man's home in Surrey at dawn this morning. The retired officer worked as part of the Metropolitan Police’s Specialist Operations command, which has a host of security duties from providing armed protection for MPs and the Royal Family to counter-terrorism intelligence gathering. Dawn raid: Police from Operation Elveden, which runs alongside the force's Operation Weeting investigation into phone hacking, swooped on the 57-year-old man's home in Surrey at 6.30 this morning. While officers searched his home, he was taken for questioning on suspicion of misconduct in a public office. His is the 27th arrest by detectives working under Operation Elveden, the investigation into illegal payments made by journalists to public figures. A force statement said: 'The 57-year-old man was arrested at his home address. 'He previously served in the MPS Specialist Operations command, based in central London, and retired several years ago. Payments: Giving evidence to the Leveson Inquiry. in January, The Sun's Royal Editor Duncan Larcombe acknowledged it was 'no secret' that his paper. offers members of the public payments in return for tip-offs. He was arrested two weeks ago. 'He is currently being questioned at a south west London police station and his home address is being searched.' The. force added that the arrest 'is not about seeking journalists to reveal. confidential sources in relation to information that has been obtained. legitimately'. The arrest. comes a fortnight after The Sun's royal editor, Duncan Larcombe, was. arrested along with a 42-year-old former member of the Armed Forces and a. 38-year-old woman as part of the same inquiry. Arrested: Last month, The Sun's defence editor Virginia Wheeler, 32, was held on suspicion of illegal payments to police. Power: Mr Yates has expressed 'extreme regret' for ruling out reopening the hacking investigation at News International in 2009. So far the investigation has seen 12 journalists from The Sun newspaper detained in a scandal that has sent shockwaves across Fleet Street. Last month, The Sun's defence editor Virginia Wheeler, 32, was held on suspicion of illegal payments to police. The Sun’s deputy editor Geoff Webster,. picture editor John Edwards, chief reporter John Kay, chief foreign. correspondent Nick Parker, and news editor John Sturgis were arrested in February. And the previous month former. managing editor Graham Dudman, 48, now a training director at News. International; executive editor Fergus Shanahan, 56, a former deputy. editor of the paper under Rebekah Brooks; long-serving crime editor Mike. Sullivan, 48; and head of news Chris Pharo, 42 were also detained and later bailed.

The MSC was set up in the wake of the phone-hacking scandal that led to the closure of the News of the World last July. It is carrying out internal. investigations relating to Rupert Murdoch's remaining UK papers - The.

The state appealed, and on Friday, Superior Court Judge Carl J. Schuman overturned that ruling, and his reasoning was thus: Connecticut statutes hold that private property seized via search warrant and not used in a criminal trial be returned to the owner at the conclusion of the case; this trumps the FOIA. The Courant points out that no one has voiced a privacy concern in relation to the documents, but Schuman said his ruling must apply to similar situations less \"unusual\" than Lanza\\'s. As for what\\'s known of the documents, they include Lanza\\'s handwritten notes, a spreadsheet that tracked the details of mass killings, and \"The Big Book of Granny.\" A November 2013 Courant article written upon the release of the state police\\'s summary of its nearly year-long investigation shared details of the eight-chapter book, which featured a gun-slinging Granny, her son, and Dora the Beserker. In the book, written as a school project with another classmate when the two were fifth-graders, Granny robs a bank, kills soldiers, wipes out the Beatles, and threatens to murder schoolkids. The assignment was never turned in.',\n",

Personally, I love Askey, perhaps it's because I go into his world, rather than unreasonably expecting him to come into mine, which is a mistake too many people make. The Ghost Train is so intensely atmospheric that you couldn't conceivably watch it without being amazed at the deep, dark world it transports you to, it is immersive in a way that few cheap and cheerful flag-wavers managed to be during the desperate early '40s and it's a film that I would imagine few people have ever watched just the once. The cast are, without exception, extraordinarily good, perhaps Linden Travers lays it on a bit thick, but against the backdrop of a lonely railway station in wartime, she could hardly play a nutter and not stand out.

              " \"Why is this film so bad? Well, if being so stupidly annoying and unfunny is a reason, then this film is it. The character of Corky Romano is unlikable at best and downright infuriating at worst. The gags are predictable but that isn't what makes it bad. They are the lame sort of predictable jokes that your unfunny friend would say.\\n\\nCorky Romano is about a mild mannered vet that tries to do right but is so clumsy. His quiet life is thrown for a loop when the family that once spurned him now needs him to infiltrate the FBI to destroy any trace of the family's crime history. However, it isn't that easy for Corky because the FBI believes him to be a super agent and pegs him with the duty of spying on his very own family. Mishaps and mayhem ensue but it really doesn't feel like any comic hijixn are there. Corky ends up in love with his beautiful FBI partner and has to set the record straight with both the FBI and his family if he is to settle down to the quiet life again.\\n\\nI think what makes this film irritating is both the lead actor and the supposed jokes. Chris Kattan reveals his alarming limitations as and actor here as his one note slapstick routine falls flat about 10 minutes into the film. It is okay to have a full movie based solely off of dumb, slap stick humor. Will Ferrel, Kattan's SNL partner, seems to have made a full career out of it. The only difference between Kattan and Ferrel is that Ferrel knows when to tone it down and rely on other ways of telling a joke. There is absolutely no diversity in Kattan's routine. It's hard to hear the same joke twice, but for a whole movie that is just pure torture.\\n\\nThe other problem with the movie was the lack of truly original and FUNNY jokes. The gay mafia brother, the awkward guy sch-tick, and plenty of other forgettable jokes appear none as funny as the first time you barely laughed at it. It seems as if the screenwriters had more of a fun time writing this than any one had watching it. Even with a cast that has some comedic talent (Chris Penn, Peter Falk) the jokes that commence are tired. There is no chemistry too. This film was obviously one for the pocketbooks for the actors. No body seemed to care about it, or even try. Sad thing is, no body told Chris Kattan that.\",\n",

Also excited, apparently, was United Airlines, which had been closely following Carter\\'s story on its own since tweeting last month that if Carter got to 18 million retweets, it would fly him to any Wendy\\'s in the world, as long as it was in a city it serviced. Even though Carter didn\\'t come near the 18 million mark (he\\'s at 3.57 million), United decided to honor him anyway, as Wendy\\'s had, and tweeted at him Wednesday to \"decide where in the world you\\'d like to visit.\" But as Mashable reports, the airline\\'s very public PR attempt backfired, in a very public way, mainly because Twitter has a long memory.

The tweets responding to United\\'s gesture referenced those other incidents, with one warning Carter not to wear leggings on his flight, while another noted the offer was a \"trap\" to \"reaccomodate\" [sic] Carter (a reference to the airline\\'s response to the Dao fiasco).

              " \"When fixing the flapper and adjusting the water level in the tank doesn’t fix a running toilet, it usually means there's a problem with the fill valve. The solution for this is replacing the fill valve. To do this, you must work with an empty tank:  Turn off the water to the toilet. Flush the toilet. Use a sponge to absorb remaining water from the tank. Soak the sponge, wring it out in the sink, and continue until there's no water left in the tank. On the outside of the toilet, there will be a water supply line running into the tank. To disconnect this, unscrew the locknut securing the line in place. Turn the screw counterclockwise to loosen it. You may need a pair of pliers to loosen the locknut. Once the supply line has been disconnected, you'll see a lock nut attaching the fill valve assembly to the toilet on the outside of the tank. Remove this by using an adjustable wrench to turn the lock nut to the left (counterclockwise). Once the lock nut is off, you can pull the old fill valve assembly out from the toilet tank.  You may want to take the old assembly to the hardware store when you purchase the replacement. That way, you can be sure to get the right size and style fill valve for your toilet. Alternatively, you can purchase a universal fill valve. You can replace older ball float fill valves with more modern float cup style ones. Insert the new fill valve into the same place in the tank. Fit the valve into the hole in the tank where the water supply line comes in. Hook up the water supply line. Tighten the nut in a clockwise direction to tighten it. Once the locknut has been hand tightened, use the pliers to turn the nut another quarter turn. Connect the fill tube to the water output nozzle at the top of the fill valve. Position the fill tube so it’s draining into the overflow tube. If there's a clip on the overflow tube, attach the fill tube to the clip to keep it in place. Check the manufacturer’s directions to determine the correct float height for the fill valve you purchased. Use a measuring tape to measure from the bottom of the tank, and adjust the fill valve to the right height by turning the adjustment screw. Turn the water back on and let the toilet tank fill with water. Check the water level, make sure the fill tube isn't in the water, and listen that there isn't any water running. Adjust the float height if necessary. Test the toilet by flushing it and letting it fill up again. Once the toilet has been fixed and is no longer running, carefully place the tank lid back on.\",\n",

              " \"A teacher who seduced a boy at her school has been spared prison so she can look after her seriously ill husband and their son. Jacqueline Marks, 33, had sex with the 16-year-old pupil in her marital home and in her car. The head of maths at a school in Welwyn Garden City, Hertfordshire, finally ended the relationship after nearly two months. Jacqueline Marks, 33 (pictured outside court today), had full sex four times with the 16-year-old boy during a two-month relationship which also included incidents of touching, kissing and oral sex. She was spared jail. But she was caught out when an ex-girlfriend of the teenager found explicit messages on his iPad. Judge Jonathan Howarth yesterday told Marks she ‘richly deserved to go to prison’ for the ‘serious breach of trust’. But he gave her a nine-month sentence, suspended for two years, after hearing her husband had a heart condition. ‘You bear full responsibility for the breach of the law in this case … there is nothing in your personal mitigation that had led me to suspend the sentence,’ the judge said. ‘But you have a seven-year-old son and you are responsible for his care. ‘You have a husband who in the latter months of last year suffered a serious illness. ‘He is due to have a series of operations – the first of which is on February 27. Your role as a mother and wife is clearly crucial to them.’ Marks had taught the boy, who cannot be identified for legal reasons, for several years at the secondary school. She took him for seven lessons every week and had begun giving him extra maths tutoring which was organised by the school. Marks (pictured outside court, right) admitted having four sex sessions with the teenager - three times in her car and once at her home in Stevenage, Hertfordshire.\\xa0She admitted six counts of abusing a position of trust. Edward Renvoize, prosecuting, said by January last year Marks felt ‘flattered’ by the attention the pupil was showing her and a sexual relationship began in May. ‘It escalated to cuddles and kisses and to her performing oral sex on him and then having full sex, once at her home and three times in her car,’ he added. Marks brought the affair to an end as the boy approached his GCSE exams and thought her secret was safe. But on June 23 the boy’s former girlfriend found messages on his iPad. She guessed who was involved, even though Marks was not named in them. Details of the incriminating messages were not given at Cambridge Crown Court. But Mr Renvoize added: ‘[The boy’s ex-girlfriend] was able to work out who the text messages had come from and she showed them to her mother. Marks was also banned from working with males under 18 for the next five years\\xa0at Cambridge Crown Court (pictured). She was also subjected to supervision requirements and ordered to sign the sex offenders' register. 'When the boy was confronted, he said, “I’ve done it, although it’s not as bad as it looks”.’ Both the school and police were contacted. Marks, of Stevenage, was arrested and at first refused to answer questions but made a full confession in a second interview. Checks on a personal computer revealed she had been visiting sites concerning relationships between teachers and pupils. Marks wept as Paul Kaufman, defending, said: ‘As a consequence of what has taken place, the defendant has lost her career, which she valued hugely and enjoyed. ‘She has lost her status in the community and her complete circle of friends.’ He added that her husband was facing five operations for his heart condition over the next year. As a result of his illness, she was helping him run his small business. ‘The husband has had to deal with the most devastating news,’ Mr Kaufman said. ‘He has accepted it and is prepared to make a go of the marriage.’ Marks admitted six counts of abusing a position of trust. She was banned from working unsupervised with males under the age of 18, and her name will be on the Sex Offenders Register for the next ten years. The victim’s family declined to comment.\",\n",

              " \"Strange, came here on a whim after not having reservations anywhere in Vegas, and being extremely hungry at 8:30pm, which would have been peak hours. Guess I was lucky that night. Come to think of it, I was. I made $475 at roulette that night.   Asked for a table for 3 - and immediate seating, right along the outer wall, so that we could people watch. No bad experience with 45 minute waits, or being rejected for seating. Strange group of people sifting through Vegas at those hours.  Ordered a carpaccio, and a special rib-eye steak pasta. My girlfriend ordered the Calamari and Fusilli pasta, with proscuitto, peas, and truffle butter.  Carpaccio - Not sure what to expect. Quite good, peppery with the peppercorns, arugula. Felt like it was missing some dressing, however. Parmesan Regianno was a bit overpowering. Seasoned mushrooms on top of the carpaccio was a good touch though.  Calamari - Excellent consistency and seasoning. Not overpoweringly salty, tender calamari, but crispy batter on outside. Slight lime flavoring to accompany the taste. Basil aioli was a bit excessive, but nicely placed on the side, so completely optional. Fried pepperoncini also was quite good, made me want to eat it even though I'm not a fan of milder peppers in general.  Rib-eye pasta - A very heavy pasta, using Radiatore pasta, with rib-eye steak and caramelized onions. Rib-eye was a bit overdone, in my opinion. Did not seem as tender, and did not take advantage of the natural marbling of typical rib-eye. May not have been the best cut. However, flavoring was excellent. Very hearty, like a stew. Good for a warmer day, though in Vegas, that never happens.  Fusilli - Brilliant pasta dish. Although, it's not hard to mess up this one. Simple Fusilli con Piselli e Proscuitto. Though tasted so rich, likely due to truffle butter. Mmm. Truffle butter.  Service was a bit weird. We had another over-excited waiter. Edged on creepy. Though he was there when we needed him, and very witty for the times - I believe he took us to be a young crowd, and adapted accordingly.  5 stars - Excellent food - and reasonable prices. -1 for overcooked ribeye in pasta. +1 for immediate seating. +2 for excellent tender and yet crispy calamari (probably some of the best I've had), and truffle butter.\",\n",

GlobalGrind has confirmed this very sad news. \\n  \\n One of our heroes, Adam Yauch aka MCA of the Beastie Boys, passed away yesterday morning after a long bout with cancer. \\n  \\n UPDATE: Adam\\'s mother, France Yauch spoke this afternoon to the New York Times, \\n  \\n Mr. Yauch’s mother said he died at 9 a.m. on Friday at New York-Presbyterian Hospital in Manhattan with his parents, his in-laws, his wife, Dechen Wangdu, and his 13-year-old daughter, Tenzin Losel Yauch, at his bedside. He had been admitted to the hospital on April 14 after a three-year battle with cancer of the salivary gland. He was conscious until the end. “He was a very courageous person,” his mother, Frances Yauch, said. “He fought a long battle with cancer. He was hopeful to the very end.” Mrs. Yauch said he had been undergoing chemotherapy this spring, but his health deteriorated rapidly over the last two weeks. “It all just seemed to happen overnight,” she said. She added: “He was a terrific guy and had a brief but really wonderful life. We are really proud of him.” \\n  \\n Yauch was a member of the groundbreaking, incredibly innovative and creative group, The Beastie Boys, with his two friends, Mike D and Ad-Roc, which changed our culture forever. \\n  \\n Yauch was born an only child in Brooklyn, New York, the son of Frances and Noel Yauch, a painter and architect. His father was Catholic and his mother was Jewish. \\n  \\n Throughout high school, he taught himself to play the bass guitar. The Beasties first show, then still a hardcore punk band, while still attending Edward R. Murrow High School in the Midwood neighborhood of Brooklyn. \\n  \\n Yauch attended Bard College for two years before dropping out. Two years later, at the age of 22, the Beastie Boys, now performing as a hip-hop trio, released their first album Licensed to Ill on Def Jam Records. \\n  \\n In 2009, Yauch was treated for a cancerous parotid gland and a lymph node and underwent surgery and radiation therapy. He later made a video announcement about his diagnosis. \\n  \\n He is survived by his wife and daughter. He was 47. \\n  \\n Our prayers go out to the family of Adam and the entire Beastie Boys crew. ||||| Actor LL Cool J appears in the press room after presenting the Beastie Boys for induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Friday, April 13, 2012, in Cleveland.

He was 47. ||||| An obituary for Adam Yauch, by The Times’s Jon Pareles, is available here. \\n  \\n Marko Djurica/Reuters \\n  \\n Adam Yauch, one of the founders of the seminal hip-hop group the Beastie Boys, has died of cancer at the age of 47, his mother, Frances Yauch, said in a phone conversation. \\n  \\n Mr. Yauch, who went by the moniker MCA, had been battling cancer since 2009, when a tumor was discovered in his salivary gland. He did not come to the Beastie Boys induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in April and his treatments for the illness forced the group to delay the release of their last album “Hot Sauce Committee, Pt. 2.” \\n  \\n Emerging from the hard-core punk scene in New York in the late 1970s, the Beastie Boys were the first white group to successfully sing rap songs and have remained popular for more than a quarter century. Mr. Yauch co-founded the group with Mike Diamond (Mike D) and Adam Horovitz (Ad-Rock) as a punk band in 1981 and first began experimenting with hip-hop the following year, when they released a 12-inch vinyl rap spoof “Cooky Puss.” All three were teenagers from affluent New York families when they met. \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n But in 1986, they crossed into the rap mainstream with “Licensed to Ill,” which was the first hip-hop album to hit No. 1 on the albums chart and featured hits like “(You Gotta) Fight for Your Right (to Party)” and “Brass Monkey.” It was just the first of a string of hit records, like 1989’s “Paul’s Boutique,” 1992’s “Check Your Head” and 1994’s “Ill Communication.” \\n  \\n Mr. Yauch (pronounced YOWK), a practicing Buddhist, was also involved in the movement to free Tibet and organized concerts for the cause in the late 1990s, and he and his band mates started an indie record label in the 1990s called Grand Royal. His interests also extended beyond music, particularly film. Under the name Nathanial Hörnblowér, he directed many of the Beastie Boys’ music videos and their 2006 concert film, which was shot by fans, while under his own name, he released “Gunnin’ for That #1 Spot,” a documentary about high school basketball players. (In 2004, Mr. Yauch, under the pseudonym Nathanial Hornblower, wrote a letter to The Times in response to a story about his music video, “Ch-Check It Out.”) And he started an independent film division of his company, Oscilloscope Laboratories, which has released critically acclaimed films like “Wendy and Lucy.” \\n  \\n When Ad-Rock and Mike D accepted the Beastie Boys’s induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame two weeks ago, they read a letter from Mr. Yauch thanking both his bandmates and the group’s fans. “I’d like to dedicate this to my brothers Adam and Mike,” he wrote. “They walked the globe with me. It’s also for anyone who has ever been touched by our band. This induction is as much ours as it is yours.” \\n  \\n Mr. Yauch’s mother said he died at 9 a.m. on Friday at New York-Presbyterian Hospital in Manhattan with his parents, his in-laws, his wife, Dechen Wangdu, and his 13-year-old daughter, Tenzin Losel Yauch, at his bedside.

              " \"By. Daily Mail Reporter. UPDATED:. 04:57 EST, 23 February 2012. Rowan Atkinson has claimed the BBC should have been allowed to axe Miriam O’Reilly from Countryfile without facing claims of age discrimination. The Blackadder and Mr Bean star criticised the presenter’s landmark ageism tribunal victory last year, saying it was an ‘attack on creative free expression’. The 57-year-old said ‘creative industries’ were ‘completely inappropriate environments’ for anti-discrimination legislation – and the ‘legal tools’ she used to win her case ‘should never have been available to her’. Wading into the row: Rowan Atkinson (left) said the BBC should have been allowed to axe Miriam O'Reilly (right) without facing discrimination claims. He said her complaint that she was axed from Countryfile due to her age – she was then 51 – was ‘no more sensible’ than Pierce Brosnan complaining he was dropped as James Bond for being too old, ‘which he was and which he is’. In a letter to Radio 4’s The Media Show, Mr Atkinson said if programme-makers wanted to replace an ‘old person with a young person’ or ‘a white person with a black person’ or a ‘disabled straight with an able-bodied gay’ they should have the ‘creative freedom to do so’. Revamped: Countryfile presenters Matt Baker, Julia Bradbury and John Craven. Miss O’Reilly, now 54, won her age discrimination case after she was dropped from Countryfile when it was revamped. Last night she said: ‘I think very few people will agree with Mr Atkinson. 'Television has an enormous influence on shaping society and how we see each other and we have got to have fair representation of everyone on TV.’\",\n",
              " 'Lock eyes for a brief moment, then drop your gaze to the floor before slowly sweeping it back up again. This simple yet coy gesture says that even though you know it’s not polite to stare, he’s so alluring that you can’t help but take a second look. If you pull it off just right, there’s no way he won’t notice you noticing him.  A look can be incredibly expressive—like the old saying goes, the eyes are the windows to the soul. Try to tell him how you feel about him through your eyes. Chances are, he’ll get the message. Avoid staring him down. Leering at someone straight on for too long can suggest that you’re indifferent towards him, or worse, that you find him off-putting. Whether you’re deep in conversation or just exchanging glances from across the room, your smile is your most effective tool for signaling attraction. A genuine smile indicates warmth and openness and makes you that much more inviting to be around. While smiling is essential for sparking romantic interest, you should only do it if it feels natural. Otherwise, it could make for some unintentionally awkward moments. Never underestimate the power of touch. Reaching out to get his attention or standing close enough to just brush up against him can be a great way to bridge the metaphorical distance between the two of you and suggest that you desire some sort of physical intimacy.  Make it a point to take his hand or go for a hug when saying your greetings and goodbyes.  Keep in mind that some forms of touch are more suggestive than others. For example, grasping his arm when he makes a joke is flirtatious but fairly safe. Placing your hand on his thigh, however, may send an entirely different message. Eliminating the literal distance between you will give him the sense that you want to get closer emotionally, as well. It also helps to shut out surrounding distractions, making you feel like the only two people in the room. To avoid freaking him out, make sure you move in gracefully and in a way that feels natural.  One of the best times to get up close and personal is during conversation. Leaning in while he tells a story or discusses his personal life makes it clear that you’re hanging on his every word.  By contrast, leaning back or moving away can be seen as a sign that you want to keep some space between you. Leg crossing is a bolder and more direct way of expressing your interest, and is perfect for when you want to turn the heat up a notch. Because of the subtle sexual implications of the gesture, it’s best to only break it out when you’re talking to a guy you really like.  Drawing attention to your legs can be very seductive, especially when paired with other confident body language. Avoid hunching over, bouncing your knees, or displaying any other nervous tics. This could be seen as a sign that you’re uncomfortable, or make him feel like he has power over you. As you’re talking or making eye contact, run your fingers through your locks or brush a few stray strands out of your face, fixing your hair can convey a kind of excited nervousness, letting him know that he’s succeeded in getting under your skin. As a bonus, you can make sure your looks are on point before you go up to him and say hi. As with crossing your legs, there’s a right and wrong way to play with your hair. Doing it too much can scream “boredom” or make you seem more concerned with your appearance than with his presence. When you really want to make your feelings known, run the tip of your tongue over your lips to make them plump, juicy, and rosy red. Wetting your lips is a dead giveaway that you’ve got the hots for a certain someone. And if you are lucky enough to score a goodnight kiss, they’ll be primed and ready.  Licking your lips at an opportune time is sure to plant the idea of kissing in his head.  If you’re wearing a face full of makeup, be careful not to lick too often or too vigorously, or you could end up looking you just won a pie eating contest.',\n",

As it turns out, even an aircraft full of handymen might not suffice, as demonstrated on a recent Norwegian flight. \\n  \\n Flight DY1156 took off from Oslo Gardermoen at 9.34am on 27 January, headed for Munich. However, the aircraft only got as far as the Swedish border before it had to turn back, circling four times over Hedmark to get rid of excess fuel and then landing at Oslo. \\n  \\n The flight was aborted as a result of a problem with the toilets on board, according to Norwegian communications advisor Fatima Elkadi. \\n  \\n “It is true that DY1156, which was to fly from Oslo to Munich, had to return to Oslo again when they found an issue with the toilets on board,” she told Dagbladet, a Norwegian news site. \\n  \\n The irony is that around 85 of the passengers were plumbers, many of them from Rørkjøp plumbing company. \\n  \\n Rørkjøp CEO Frank Olsen said he would have liked to have a crack at it but was thwarted by a technicality. \\n  \\n “We would have liked to fix the restrooms, but unfortunately it had to be done from the outside and we didn’t risk sending a plumber to work at 10,000m,” he told Dagbladet. “There was a good atmosphere in the plane, what with the irony about the broken toilets.” \\n  \\n 🛫🚽🛬 Norwegian flight #DY1156 with 84 plumbers on board was forced to return to Oslo becasue of a problem the toilets on board.https://t.co/lUPlJIxGMU pic.twitter.com/I5YqeR6hvJ — Flightradar24 (@flightradar24) 29 January 2018 \\n  \\n Hans Christian Ødegård, a plumber from company Ulstein, added: “So many plumbers on a plane and it has to turn around because of toilet trouble – there’s good humour in that.” \\n  \\n Technicians at Gardermoen soon fixed the problem and the plane took off again, landing in Munich at around 12pm. ||||| A Norwegian flight with a broken toilet was forced to return to Oslo only 20 minutes into the journey - despite the plane being full of plumbers. \\n  \\n The service from the Norwegian capital bound for the German city of Munich - a two hour and 20 minute flight - was carrying 85 tradesmen from the country’s plumbing industry including 65 from one company, Rørkjøp. \\n  \\n But the army of plumbers was unable to fix the faulty loo. \\n  \\n “We would have liked to fix the restrooms, but unfortunately it had to be done from the outside and we did not take the opportunity to send a plumber [out] at 10,000 metres,” Rørkjøp ceo Frank Olsen told Norwegian newspaper Dagbladet. \\n  \\n Data from FlightRadar24.com shows the Boeing 737 aircraft departed Oslo at 8:28 local time, climbed to 33,000 feet, before turning around.

              " '– A Florida mom whose refusal to permit her son to be circumcised led her to go into hiding for nearly 3 months was arrested for contempt of court yesterday. Heather Hironimus has been battling with Dennis Nebus, the father of her 4-year-old son Chase, because Nebus wants Chase circumcised and she does not. Hironimus initially agreed the procedure could be done but later changed her mind, arguing it was not medically necessary. After a long legal battle, a judge in February ordered Hironimus to bring Chase to court and turn him over to his father to have the procedure done, but Hironimus didn\\'t show up; her attorney said she had \"sought refuge\" Feb. 23 at a domestic violence shelter. In March, the same judge issued a warrant for her arrest. Broward County authorities took her into custody yesterday; she\\'s now at the Broward County jail, the Palm Beach Post reports. Chase\\'s location is not clear; the boy hasn\\'t seen his father since Feb. 19, Local 10 reports. In March, Hironimus\\' lawyer asked the judge to consider giving Chase a mental health exam before moving forward, claiming the boy \"is scared to death of the procedure and doesn\\'t want it,\" the Sun Sentinel reported at the time. The judge refused and ordered Hironimus\\' arrest; he also specifically took issue with the fact that she had partnered with anti-circumcision \"intactivists\" that \"plastered\" Chase\\'s name and picture \"all over the Internet.\" While she was in hiding, Hironimus filed a federal lawsuit through her lawyer claiming circumcision would violate Chase\\'s constitutional rights, the Sun Sentinel reported last month.

We arrived at 10pm on Thanksgiving night and were swiftly and courteously checked in by the staff.  We were assigned our room in the Paradise Tower (newer but farther from the casino).  The room was more spacious than I expected, the linens and beds were nice, and there was a big screen TV.  Off to a good start.  We headed down to the casino floor and began gambling. Charming dealers and box men/women had us in stitches all night and one of my friends even won a good deal of money. The drinks and cards kept coming at a solid pace, and despite minor financial woes and liver damage, we were no worse for the wear. We had a blast that first night and stayed out until the sun was high in the morning sky.  The next night was a similar experience, though this time with a trip to the hotel\\'s steakhouse, Rare 120.  While the meat was undercooked (leaving me to think that the place was aptly named), the service was good, the apps were delicious, and they were happy to oblige us by bringing over another table when two ladies joined us mid-dinner.  Also, thanks to our gaming on the previous night, the dinner was comped.    Later that evening, a friend of one of the gentlemen I was traveling with came to visit us at the hotel.  We met him outside, he came in and sat down for some blackjack.  Next, the three of us got up from the table to head to the bathroom.  Once in the bathroom, we were approached by a uniformed police officer with a dog.  Cornered and without means of exit, he asked for our IDs and had them photocopied.  When asked the meaning of this shakedown, he replied \"It\\'s private property, we don\\'t need a reason.\"  But it became painfully obvious what the reason was.  Our friend who came to visit us, who is an Emmy award winning actor, by the way, was black. Myself and my other friend who was present were white. Plain as day, abject racism that was the only conceivable reason for such a ridiculous use of intimidation.  As a hotel guest and someone who had spent thousands of dollars in their establishment, I was mortified.  They let us go on our way, and we headed back up to the room to bid our friend a good evening.  Ten minutes later, he called to tell us that when he went back downstairs he was asked to leave. \"Private property,\" they told him.  The next morning we spoke with the floor manager, who assured us that everything was done according to their \"code\".  I suppose their code includes singling out black people for humiliation and ejection from the premises.  Despite everything else in the weekend being near perfect, I will never ever return to the Hard Rock because of the racism and humiliation I experienced as a guest there.

              " \"By. Associated Press Reporter. PUBLISHED:. 19:56 EST, 5 August 2013. |. UPDATED:. 02:19 EST, 6 August 2013. John Errol Ferguson was executed on Monday. He was convicted of murdering eight people in the late 1970s. A man convicted of murdering eight people in Miami-Dade County in the late 1970s was executed Monday night at the Florida State Prison, despite his lawyers' pleas that he was too mentally ill to be put to death. John Errol Ferguson, 65, died at 6:17 p.m. following a lethal injection. The execution came less than two hours after the U.S. Supreme Court denied a final request for a stay. Before the execution, Ferguson made a brief statement before 25 witnesses, including family members of the victims. 'I just want everyone to know that I am the prince of God and will rise again,' he said calmly. At about three minutes into the procedure, he moved his head, strained his neck, moved his feet, put his head back down and closed his eyes. The entire execution took 16 minutes. About three dozen people protested across the street from the prison. Ferguson and two others were convicted of murdering six people in 1977 during a robbery at a Carol City house used by marijuana dealers. Ferguson dressed as a utility worker to gain access and let his accomplices inside. Most of the victims were friends who happened to drop by the house while Ferguson and the other men were there. The victims were blindfolded and bound, and the encounter turned violent after a mask fell off one of Ferguson's gang members and his face was spotted by a victim. Protesters to the death penalty talk as they wait for the execution of John Errol Ferguson, across the highway from the Florida State Correctional facility. The decision was made to kill all eight people in the house. Two survived. At the time, it was the worst mass slaying ever in Miami-Dade County. Ferguson also was convicted of the 1978 murder of a 17-year-old couple, Brian Glenfeldt and Belinda Worley, from Hialeah. They were shot as Ferguson, dressed as a police officer, tried to rob them while they were parked at a lovers' lane. Worley was raped. The randomness of the crime and the youth of the two victims stunned many in Miami. Ferguson confessed to killing 'the two kids' after he was arrested in April 1978 for the earlier killings, court records show. Worley's mother, Edna Worley, waited for decades for Ferguson's execution but died last year. Ferguson was sentenced to die in both cases; he unsuccessfully used the insanity defense in the trial over the teenagers' murders. Protesters against the death penalty await the execution of John Errol Ferguson in Florida. The issue of Ferguson's mental stability was a current that ran through his life, and his execution came after months of court appeals. Ferguson's lawyers said their client had a long history of mental illness. The attorneys appealed his case to the U.S. Supreme Court, saying that Ferguson lacked 'rational understanding' that he will be executed and that killing him would 'cruel and unusual punishment,' violating the Eighth Amendment. Christopher Handman, Ferguson's lead attorney, said his client's mental illness manifested itself long before the slayings. Ferguson's alcoholic father died when Ferguson was 13, and that's when he started experiencing hallucinations, family members told the attorney. Ferguson also experienced abuse by his mother's boyfriends, then was abandoned by his mom and raised by his sisters in a vermin-infested shack in Miami-Dade County. When he was 21, he was shot in the head by a police officer in Miami. For several years in the 1970s, Ferguson was in a state mental hospital and was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia; he was twice found not guilty of crimes by reason of insanity. Handman said one doctor wrote that Ferguson should not be released because he was a danger to himself and to society. But he was released and, months later, committed the Carol City murders. Christopher Handman, an attorney for Ferguson, said Monday in a statement that he was disappointed in the Supreme Court's decision, denying his client a stay of execution. 'Mr. Ferguson is insane and incompetent for execution by any measure,' Handman said. 'He has a fixed delusion that he is the `Prince of God' who cannot be killed and will rise up after his execution to fight alongside Jesus and save America from a communist plot. He has no rational understanding of the reason for his execution or the effect the death penalty will have upon him.' Earlier in the day, Ferguson chose to eat the same food other prisoners were being served as his final meal: A meat and vegetable patty, white bread, stewed tomatoes, potato salad, carrots and iced tea.\",\n",

              " \"Before you can freeze your cake for later consumption, you must let it cool. So if you've just baked a cake, put it aside for about three hours. Lightly place your hand on it to make sure it's cool to the touch. If you're freezing a store-bought cake, or a cake that has already cooled, skip this first step. Most cakes will freeze well due to the high fat content in them. If your cake doesn't have fat (like fat-free cakes), it won't freeze well and you should avoid putting it in the freezer. Your cake has to be protected from freezer condensation, so using a moisture-proof wrapping is key to preserve your cake's flavor and texture. You have a few options:  Plastic wrap: this wrapping material is always well suited, but might require multiple layers as moisture might get in. Plastic wrap is easy to wrap and fairly durable. Aluminum foil: this wrapping foil is probably one of the best barrier films as it's impervious to light, moisture and bacteria. One major disadvantage is that it tears very easily. Place the wrapped cake into a metallic tin, if desired. This protects the cakes from being knocked by other items, makes it very easy to find and provides added protection from moisture and freezer odors, such as seafood. Then, take the pan with your cake in it, and flip it upside down. Your cake should come out of the pan without much work on your end.  If the cake doesn't come out right away, get a knife and slide along the edges of your pan (between the pan and the actual cake). If you previously removed your cake from its baking pan, skip this step. Now, simply use your wrapping to envelop the cake. Make sure you're wrapping your cake tightly, without much room for air between the cake and the wrapping. You're now ready to freeze your cake for storage. Make sure you have enough space and try not to position your cake next to foods with strong flavors and odors (like seafood). Your cake could well absorb some odors, and even flavors, so you should ideally have a spot where your cake won't be around other food items. You might even consider cleaning your freezer before placing your cake in it. This will greatly improve your cake's flavor and odor retention. A cake will generally freeze well for a few months, but not more than that. Whilst freezing initially retains the moisture of a pre-baked cake, cakes will tend to dry out after two months of freezing and you can expect the flavor to change at around four months. Once you're ready to frost your cake, simply take it out of the freezer and let it thaw for about 40 minutes. Then, frost it to your liking.\",\n",
